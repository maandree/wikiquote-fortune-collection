Michael: [V.O.] Covert intelligence involves a lot of waiting around. Any meeting, any appointment, you have to show up early, make sure you are not followed; make sure the area is secured; check out the other guy's advance team and see how well he is prepared. It's good trade craft but it's like hanging out in your dentist's reception area 24 hours a day. You read magazines, sip coffee, and every once in a while someone tries to kill you.

Michael: [V.O.] The thing about security is that the very things that protect you can be turned against you by someone who knows what he's doing. It's tough to compromise a well thought-out security system, but making someone think you can compromise it, well, that's much easier. Take surveillance cameras, for example: you can disable one by shooting a laser at it and overloading the light sensitive chip. Cheap, easy, and exactly the sort of thing a sophisticated criminal gang with lots of resources would do. Leave around some tell-tale signs of surveillance like cigarette butts, a forgotten camera lens cap and the more security there is, the more likely they are to think they've got a very serious problem. Even the security team itself can be an opportunity. The more employees you have, the more you have to worry about them. Deliver some vague threats and a few hundred bucks to a security guard. If he's honest he'll tell his boss, who then wonders who wasn't so honest. For the cost of a nice dinner you can get a whole security team canned.

Michael: [V.O.] One of the hardest things to do in a fight is to make it look like you're trying to kill someone without doing any permanent damage. They don't teach any half-moves in combat training. There are moves designed to kill and maim as efficiently as possible. If those are off limits, one option is open your fist right before a punch lands. Painful, but the force is distributed. Another showy option is a kick to the shoulder. You might break a rib or two; but if you aim right, nobody is going to the morgue.

Michael: [V.O.] Making yourself invisible when you need to is a crucial skill for a covert operative; it sounds exotic but it's not like there's a super-secret move they teach you at spy school that allows you to vanish into thin air. Often it's just a matter of quick thinking, fast feet, and strong fingers.

Michael: [V.O.] Tailing a trained operative requires a number of time consuming preparations: everything from acquiring a vehicle they can't recognize or trace to familiarizing yourself with all the local traffic patterns. Of course, since you can never be sure who's a trained op, there's always the chance you'll take all those precautions just to follow a secretary back to her cubicle.

Michael: [V.O.] When you work in intelligence, there's no bigger slap in the face than a picture of yourself in the middle of an operation.

Michael: [V.O.] The interior locks in an office suite are usually low-end; just there to keep white-collar workers from stealing coffee cups.

Michael: [voice-over] It doesn't matter if you're trying to take out a dump truck or a moped. Every vehicle has three points of vulnerability: the driver, the engine, and the tires. A can of paint across the windshield can blind the driver. A 50-millimeter cannon can take out the engine. But neither will guarantee that the truck won't swerve into oncoming traffic. But if you force a dump truck's front tires off the road, then you drastically reduce its maneuverability. Of course, getting a dump truck's tires off the road is much more difficult than it sounds, and a hell of a lot more dangerous.

Fiona: I have an idea. [Michael nods for her to continue] Instead of working with Gilroy the psychopath, instead of sneaking around to try and figure out what he wants to steal from the plane, shoot him and be done with it!

Madeline: Hello there, Michael.
Michael: Hey, Ma.
Madeline: To what do I owe the pleasure?
Michael: Well, I thought we should talk. I know that, uh, it wasn't easy while I was away.
Madeline: Having you gone is something I've gotten used to. You know what was hard? Having an FBI agent in my house telling me that you're a monster. I still don't know what's going on.
Michael: I was chasing a man named Simon. He started off, years ago, as someone who did what I did. Something happened, he changed and he hurt people and a lot of things he did got blamed on me.
Madeline: Now, how is that possible, Michael? If you weren't there?
Michael: I spent my entire career officially being nowhere. So it's not hard to pin things on someone whose job is to never have an alibi.
Madeline: Well, there other things that he said, you blew up a bridge? You shot at police? You didn't do that?
Michael: Yeah, I did. I had to get Simon. He was going to hurt more people if I didn't stop him. So, I broke the law. I worked with bad people. I did it because I had to.
Madeline: That's it? It's as simple as that?
Michael: [starting to tear up] I don't know... [pause] He laughed... When I caught Simon, he laughed. He said it was just a matter of time before I was just like him.

Michael: [voice-over] In the jungle, the first warning that a predator is approaching is silence. When violence is imminent, animals instinctively know that keeping quiet and still is their best shot at survival. Prison's a lot like the jungle. Silence is not a good sign. Averted eyes, stockpiled food, and guys wearing heavy coats on a warm day also indicate trouble's on the way.

Michael: [voice-over] Every environment has its rules and customs, and your survival often depends on knowing them. In Russia, you never refuse vodka, in Pakistan, you always clear your dinner plate, and in prison, you're careful about making eye contact. Too little eye contact, and you become a victim. Too much eye contact, and you become a threat. Either way, you're never more than a couple of blinks away from getting a shiv in your back.

Michael: [voice-over] One simple but effective trick for identifying a tail is known in the spy trade as running errands. You drive to different locations and stop, going about ordinary business in areas with open parking lots while your team follows, keeping track of the cars at each stop. It doesn't matter how good your tail is. At a certain point, they're going to pop up more than once.

Michael: [voice-over] National intelligence agencies and local law enforcement work together more often than you might think. Most metropolitan police stations have an office called a fusion center where classified intel is collected in one place. It's a great resource if you need information fast. Unfortunately, it does involve breaking into a police station.

[Sam confesses to Michael that he's found out his new girlfriend is an Admiral's wife.]
Sam: So, look, what do you think I should do here?
Michael: Go to Maitland and explain. Tell him you didn't know who she was until things had already gotten out of hand. In fact, call him right now.
Sam: Mike, that's not what I- look, I was more looking for that super-spy advice on how to keep this quiet.
Michael: You remember that thing in Kiev with Misha? When he sold out the wetwork team on their way to Paris?
Sam: Hell, yeah. What about it?
Michael: That's the kind of secret that stays secret, because if it comes out, people get sent to Siberia. This will come out as soon as Maitland looks sideways at his wife.
Sam: Seriously, Mike, you know, I know you're a smart guy, but you've dated, like, one lady, and she was a frickin' psycho. I'm just saying you may not be the expert on this whole boy-girl thing.

Fiona: Does it matter? You got what you needed.
Michael: Fi, did something happen with Armand?
Fiona: Oh, now you're full of questions. A lot happened with Armand, years ago back in Ireland in the bad old days.
Michael: Were you and he --
Fiona: Yes, we were, Michael. Until I found out that he had paid to meet me by doing a favor for some of my associates. He killed a British customs agent, if you're curious. Quite a romantic gesture, don't you think?
Michael: I didn't know that, Fiona.

	-- Burn Notice - Dead to Rights [5.12]
%
Michael: [voice-over] For a spy, finding out you've been compromised, that someone has something on you, is the ultimate nightmare. The worst part for someone who has spent a career training for every situation is knowing that there is nothing you can do but grit your teeth and try to find out exactly how bad the nightmare is going to be.

	-- Burn Notice - Dead to Rights [5.12]
%
Michael: [voice-over] For a spy, the worst thing that can happen is to become someone else's asset. You do anything you can to avoid it, making sure there's nothing people can grab onto and use as leverage. You move through life unattached, keeping the world at a distance. It's a hard way to live, but there's a cold logic to it. Love nothing, and nothing you love can be used against you. Once you violate that rule and make that connection with someone, you've handed your enemies the key to destroying you.

Michael: We have to assume we can get you out of this.
Fiona: What if we can't?
Michael: I've been past saving before, Fi. You didn't walk away and I'm not going to.
Fiona: Well, that's terribly romantic, Michael, but we don't have the numbers or the firepower to get past those guards.
Michael: Maybe we can get around them. If you set a diversion out front, I can make an approach from the water, grab Oswald before anyone knows I'm there. Please, Fi.

Michael: [voice-over] For a spy, loyalty is a strange thing. Your job is to deceive, to live among your enemies, to perform dark deeds for a noble purpose. And it's that purpose that guides you through the darkness. When you lose sight of that, the darkness is all there is.

Fiona: [in goodbye letter] Even before I knew your real name, I loved you. Before I should have, I trusted you. Because I've always known your heart. You do what's right, no matter the cost to you. And I've learned that when you love a spy, you have to be willing to make that sacrifice, too. At times, your job has made it hard to be with you, but it's never shaken my faith in you. I can't let you ruin anyone's life to save mine. I have to force you to tell what you know. If you don't, you won't be the man I love. Do the right thing. I love you, Michael. Forever.

Sam: No -- I don't.
Michael: You expect me to believe she knocked you out. How is that possible? [grabs Sam forcibly] How is that possible!
Sam: Mike, come on, man. What do you want me to say? Okay. Yeah, yeah, maybe I could have fought her off. That's right. But did it ever occur to you that maybe she was right? You were losing yourself, Mike! You were selling out everything you ever fought for!
Michael: I was fighting for her!
Sam: By burning spies? Mike, you were betraying your friends. You were about to betray your God damned government.
Michael: What do I do now, Sam? What do I do? I've just been fighting for so long, Sam, and she was all I had left.

Jason Bly: Your statement is interesting, Ms. Glenanne. Some of it even fits with what we know. Here's the problem: your story is missing a main character.
Fiona: What are you talking about?
Jason Bly: Well, we both know you didn't kill Larry Sizemore because you were suddenly overwhelmed with a desire to provide free security for the British consulate. You wouldn't have killed Larry unless you had a good reason. Like, say, protecting your boyfriend Michael Westen.
Fiona: I'm not with Michael anymore.
Jason Bly: Really? I'm surprised to hear that. The two of you were quite the couple. Not to mention the fact that I have documented cases of you two working together as recently as --
Fiona: We have a business relationship. Nothing more.
Jason Bly: Look, I understand your desire to protect him, but I'm not sure that you understand the situation that you're in here. You're going down for three counts of capital murder. Now that's a ticket to death row, but if you tell me the truth about Michael and it doesn't have to be that way.
Fiona: Michael had nothing to do with this.
Jason Bly: [slaps the table] Don't. Don't insult my intelligence. Look, this isn't personal, all right? I worked with Michael and he had his moments. I am just here to get the truth. Why don't you just tell me? What's it going to be? Fiona, trust me, you need a friend here.

Fiona: You said that the fuel tank was punctured?
Jason Bly: Yes. It ignited and that was it. He never had a chance.
Fiona: No. No, the sides of the cab would have been blasted off in a pressurized explosion. The doors are still on the hinges. This wasn't an accident. It looks more like a roadblock. You're a liar. Michael's alive.
Jason Bly: How could you possibly know that from looking at a photo?
Fiona: I know explosions, I know Michael, and I know that we are done here.

Sam: Hate to say it, Mike, but I think your mouth wrote a check that your butt can't cash. I mean, you see the section here where the C.I.A. says Ahmed is untouchable? I think that means, you know, no touching.
Michael: Maybe you missed this page: the C.I.A. doesn't care about Ahmed, they care about the intel. He's got all the files on a hard drive. We find that drive, we turn it over to the C.I.A., they'll wrap him up.
Sam: Yeah, no I definitely saw that page. Just like I saw this one here: the Agency sent a team into his Bermuda compound back in '08 looking for the hard drive. They didn't find it. What makes you think we can?
Michael: Sam, if I don't help Pearce she's going to ruin her career. Without her at the Agency I'll never get Fi out of prison.
Sam: Okay, wait wait. It says here the guy is getting ready to take a cruise. Maybe you isolate him on the boat, make him think that he's sick.
Michael: If he doesn't think that he's going to make it --
Sam: He starts talking.
Michael: And the first person he calls is his son Sharif back in Bermuda. It's perfect, Sam!
Sam: Well, perfect isn't going to work. We don't have the manpower. You've got to have three on the cruise, three on the land side, and if the C.I.A. can't know about this, well they're not going to pitch in.
Michael: I can get you a team.
