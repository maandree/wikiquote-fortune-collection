Ben: Oh no, my job's much better big guy! You know what I do, is I'm in charge of this entire arena. Every night, 17,505 people come here expecting to have a good time, and I make sure they do!
Boy: [with the same enthusiasm as before] Are you one of the players?
Ben: [taken aback] What? I just tol...what the hell's the matter with you?

Crystal: Now Alonzo, make sure you have a good mix of kids for the photo op. You know, black, white...the Himalayas are in Asia, right?
Alonzo: [nods] Mmm-hmm.
Crystal: Get me an Asian kid. Oh! And I'm gonna need some kind of a trophy. Have the Asian child hand me some kind of a trophy! [claps]
Ben: You're right to clap, because these are all very strong ideas.

[Ben walks into his office and finds Alice waiting for him]
Alice: There you are. Hey, I'm having a little....
Ben: [cuts her off] I can't pretend to listen to your problems right now, we have to talk about me!
Alice: What's wrong??
Ben: I'll tell you what's wrong! Something's happening to me! Roman, is very sad about his mother, and that makes me sad. Crystal, is very very upset about a little blue person, and that makes me upset. It's just occurring to me now, I'm actually curious, how your night went with Alonzo! What the hell's happening to me?
Alice: You're becoming an actual human being.
Ben: Well I don't like it! (storms out in a huff)

Roman: Hey, how do you just talk to a woman like that?
Ben: Well first of all, it helps to use actual words.
Roman: Yeah, I wish I could tell Heather how I feel. I just get so scared.
Ben: That's a healthy fear Roman, she's tried to kill people.
Roman: [giggles] She's layered. She is just so layered!

[Ben is helping Crystal go over her taxes]
Ben: Here's a big ticket item that has me a little confused. In 1997, you purchased Ecuador?
Crystal: [filing her nails] It's a long story. I briefly dated a man named Marcos. Put it under travel.
