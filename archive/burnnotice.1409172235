Michael: [V.O.] Covert intelligence involves a lot of waiting around. Any meeting, any appointment, you have to show up early, make sure you are not followed; make sure the area is secured; check out the other guy's advance team and see how well he is prepared. It's good trade craft but it's like hanging out in your dentist's reception area 24 hours a day. You read magazines, sip coffee, and every once in a while someone tries to kill you.

Michael: [V.O.] The thing about security is that the very things that protect you can be turned against you by someone who knows what he's doing. It's tough to compromise a well thought-out security system, but making someone think you can compromise it, well, that's much easier. Take surveillance cameras, for example: you can disable one by shooting a laser at it and overloading the light sensitive chip. Cheap, easy, and exactly the sort of thing a sophisticated criminal gang with lots of resources would do. Leave around some tell-tale signs of surveillance like cigarette butts, a forgotten camera lens cap and the more security there is, the more likely they are to think they've got a very serious problem. Even the security team itself can be an opportunity. The more employees you have, the more you have to worry about them. Deliver some vague threats and a few hundred bucks to a security guard. If he's honest he'll tell his boss, who then wonders who wasn't so honest. For the cost of a nice dinner you can get a whole security team canned.

Michael: [V.O.] One of the hardest things to do in a fight is to make it look like you're trying to kill someone without doing any permanent damage. They don't teach any half-moves in combat training. There are moves designed to kill and maim as efficiently as possible. If those are off limits, one option is open your fist right before a punch lands. Painful, but the force is distributed. Another showy option is a kick to the shoulder. You might break a rib or two; but if you aim right, nobody is going to the morgue.

Michael: [V.O.] Tailing a trained operative requires a number of time consuming preparations: everything from acquiring a vehicle they can't recognize or trace to familiarizing yourself with all the local traffic patterns. Of course, since you can never be sure who's a trained op, there's always the chance you'll take all those precautions just to follow a secretary back to her cubicle.

	-- Burn Notice - Scatter Point [2.05]

Michael: [V.O.] When you work in intelligence, there's no bigger slap in the face than a picture of yourself in the middle of an operation. It's send a clear message: we're one step ahead of you; we're in control; we own you. Mylar balloons and a bottle of champagne, that's just twisting the knife.

Michael: [V.O.] The interior locks in an office suite are usually low-end; just there to keep white-collar workers from stealing coffee cups. File cabinet locking bars, on the other hand, are a more serious security measure. Their main vulnerability is that they depend on people's faith in padlocks. People have too much faith in padlocks.

Michael: I'd say nothing. Nothing's good. Go with nothing.

	-- Burn Notice - Bad Blood [2.06]

Michael: [V.O.] Sometimes, when you meet a new operative, it's a good idea to open with an aggressive move. You learn about people when you make them play defense: their reflexes, weaknesses, how they handle themselves under pressure. And even if they are able to counter, it never hurts to know how far they're willing to go.

Michael: [V.O.] When meeting a covert operative for the first time, the arrangements can tell you a lot: if they give you a map and a photo, they trust you; a place and a time, they want to check you out before they make contact; a cryptic clue like "tidy pelican", they've just got an irritating sense of humor.

Michael: [V.O.] Spies make great neighbors; they're polite, they keep the lawn trim, and they never crank up the music at night. They don't stand out, because they don't want to be found.

Michael: [Voiceover] There's no greater luxury in the field than working with a friend you rely on. When you find someone you can trust absolutely, you want them on every operation you do, and nothing hurts worse than losing a friend to bullets, politics or something personal. But when you have to work alone again, you lock those feelings away and do the job at hand, because as every spy knows, there's time to think about what you've lost after the mission is over.

Madeline: Hello there, Michael.
Michael: Hey, Ma.
Madeline: To what do I owe the pleasure?
Michael: Well, I thought we should talk. I know that, uh, it wasn't easy while I was away.
Madeline: Having you gone is something I've gotten used to. You know what was hard? Having an FBI agent in my house telling me that you're a monster. I still don't know what's going on.
Michael: I was chasing a man named Simon. He started off, years ago, as someone who did what I did. Something happened, he changed and he hurt people and a lot of things he did got blamed on me.
Madeline: Now, how is that possible, Michael? If you weren't there?
Michael: I spent my entire career officially being nowhere. So it's not hard to pin things on someone whose job is to never have an alibi.
Madeline: Well, there other things that he said, you blew up a bridge? You shot at police? You didn't do that?
Michael: Yeah, I did. I had to get Simon. He was going to hurt more people if I didn't stop him. So, I broke the law. I worked with bad people. I did it because I had to.
Madeline: That's it? It's as simple as that?
Michael: [starting to tear up] I don't know... [pause] He laughed... When I caught Simon, he laughed. He said it was just a matter of time before I was just like him.

When violence is imminent, animals instinctively know that keeping quiet and still is their best shot at survival. Prison's a lot like the jungle. Silence is not a good sign.

In Russia, you never refuse vodka, in Pakistan, you always clear your dinner plate, and in prison, you're careful about making eye contact. Too little eye contact, and you become a victim. Too much eye contact, and you become a threat. Either way, you're never more than a couple of blinks away from getting a shiv in your back.

Michael: [voice-over] For a spy, the worst thing that can happen is to become someone else's asset. You do anything you can to avoid it, making sure there's nothing people can grab onto and use as leverage. You move through life unattached, keeping the world at a distance. It's a hard way to live, but there's a cold logic to it. Love nothing, and nothing you love can be used against you.

Michael: [voice-over] There's nothing quite like searching the home of someone you care about for evidence they've betrayed you. It's something spies have to do regularly, even with the people they love the most. It's never easy searching for something as hard as you can and praying you find nothing at all.

Fiona: I can't do this anymore. We can't do this. Let's just go. We'll go to the FBI, and I'll turn myself in. I'll make them understand.
Michael: They won't understand us. We start down that road, we can't come back. And I'll lose you. And I can't lose you.

Fiona: [in goodbye letter] Even before I knew your real name, I loved you. Before I should have, I trusted you. Because I've always known your heart. You do what's right, no matter the cost to you. And I've learned that when you love a spy, you have to be willing to make that sacrifice, too. At times, your job has made it hard to be with you, but it's never shaken my faith in you. I can't let you ruin anyone's life to save mine. I have to force you to tell what you know. If you don't, you won't be the man I love. Do the right thing. I love you, Michael. Forever.

Michael: I was too late, Sam.
Sam: Look, Mike, you can't blame yourself. I mean, there was nothing you could do. It wasn't like any of us could stop her.
Michael: And what about you, Sam?
Sam: What are you talking about?
Michael: You know exactly what I'm talking about.
Sam: No -- I don't.
Michael: You expect me to believe she knocked you out. How is that possible? [grabs Sam forcibly] How is that possible!
Sam: Mike, come on, man. What do you want me to say? Okay. Yeah, yeah, maybe I could have fought her off. That's right. But did it ever occur to you that maybe she was right? You were losing yourself, Mike! You were selling out everything you ever fought for!
Michael: I was fighting for her!
Sam: By burning spies? Mike, you were betraying your friends. You were about to betray your God damned government.
Michael: What do I do now, Sam? What do I do? I've just been fighting for so long, Sam, and she was all I had left.
Sam: Now you're just going to have to fight a little more.

Jason Bly: Your statement is interesting, Ms. Glenanne. Some of it even fits with what we know. Here's the problem: your story is missing a main character.
Fiona: What are you talking about?
Jason Bly: Well, we both know you didn't kill Larry Sizemore because you were suddenly overwhelmed with a desire to provide free security for the British consulate. You wouldn't have killed Larry unless you had a good reason. Like, say, protecting your boyfriend Michael Westen.
Fiona: I'm not with Michael anymore.
Jason Bly: Really? I'm surprised to hear that. The two of you were quite the couple. Not to mention the fact that I have documented cases of you two working together as recently as --
Fiona: We have a business relationship. Nothing more.
Jason Bly: Look, I understand your desire to protect him, but I'm not sure that you understand the situation that you're in here. You're going down for three counts of capital murder. Now that's a ticket to death row, but if you tell me the truth about Michael and it doesn't have to be that way.
Fiona: Michael had nothing to do with this.
Jason Bly: [slaps the table] Don't. Don't insult my intelligence. Look, this isn't personal, all right? I worked with Michael and he had his moments. I am just here to get the truth. Why don't you just tell me? What's it going to be? Fiona, trust me, you need a friend here.
Fiona: I have enough friends. You have my statement.

Fiona: I want to see the photos again.
Jason Bly: Why do you want to torture yourself like that?
Fiona: They were his last moments. Please.
Jason Bly: Michael lived a dangerous life and it ended tragically, but now you have a chance to live yours.
Fiona: You said that the fuel tank was punctured?
Jason Bly: Yes. It ignited and that was it. He never had a chance.
Fiona: No. No, the sides of the cab would have been blasted off in a pressurized explosion. The doors are still on the hinges. This wasn't an accident. It looks more like a roadblock. You're a liar. Michael's alive.
Jason Bly: How could you possibly know that from looking at a photo?
Fiona: I know explosions, I know Michael, and I know that we are done here.
Jason Bly: I hope that this business relationship that you have with Michael is worth it, because from the way it looks, you're going to die for him.

Fiona: [voice-over] I don’t expect to make many friends here, but then I’ve never made friends easily anyway. At least I have a little privacy. I’m not in the yard. At meals or on work duty I’m housed in a unit for violent offenders, alone. It reminds me of the first time I lost you in Ireland. I’d see you in my dreams and then I would wake up and you were still gone. The dreams hurt but they were all that kept me going. They did then and they do now. Love, Fi.

Sam: Hate to say it, Mike, but I think your mouth wrote a check that your butt can't cash. I mean, you see the section here where the C.I.A. says Ahmed is untouchable? I think that means, you know, no touching.
Michael: Maybe you missed this page: the C.I.A. doesn't care about Ahmed, they care about the intel. He's got all the files on a hard drive. We find that drive, we turn it over to the C.I.A., they'll wrap him up.
Sam: Yeah, no I definitely saw that page. Just like I saw this one here: the Agency sent a team into his Bermuda compound back in '08 looking for the hard drive. They didn't find it. What makes you think we can?
Michael: Sam, if I don't help Pearce she's going to ruin her career. Without her at the Agency I'll never get Fi out of prison.
Sam: Okay, wait wait. It says here the guy is getting ready to take a cruise. Maybe you isolate him on the boat, make him think that he's sick.
Michael: If he doesn't think that he's going to make it --
Sam: He starts talking.
Michael: And the first person he calls is his son Sharif back in Bermuda. It's perfect, Sam!
Sam: Well, perfect isn't going to work. We don't have the manpower. You've got to have three on the cruise, three on the land side, and if the C.I.A. can't know about this, well they're not going to pitch in.
Michael: I can get you a team.
Sam: [laughs] Who? Nate and your ma? Oh, wow. You're not kidding are you? Look, Mike, nothing against the Westen clan, but I'm going to be real glad when we get Fi out of the clink.

Ayn: Tomorrow at 2:15, I need that door locked tight and I need it to stay that way for about two minutes. Do me that favor and I'll help you find out who's trying to kill you.
Fiona: Doing it without getting caught would be almost impossible. I can't risk going to segregation.
Ayn: I thought that might be a deal-breaker. No hard feelings, honey.
Fiona: [writes in one of the books Ayn keeps] I said almost impossible. Get me these supplies and it's a deal.

Michael: You know what I was thinking about the other day? That little, dingy bar in Belfast, the Black Sand Pub.
Fiona: You mean when we met.

Tom Card: Imagine that you're holding on to two bottles, and they drop on the floor. What happens? They both break. But it's how they break that's important. Because you see, while one bottle crumples into a pile of glass, the other shatters into a jagged-edged weapon. You see, the exact same environment that forged older brother into a warrior, crushed baby brother. People just don't all break the same, Mrs. Westen. Just don't.
