Hammerhead: Gee, boss, no... well, sorta. The boys and I were wondering if we couldn't wait until the train stops before we steal the Ramrod!

Hammerhead: I guess we didn't think of that! [to Hoof and Mouth] Why didn't you think of that?!
Taurus Bulba: [grabs Hammerhead by the neck] Because I am the brains and you are the stooge!

Go to the St. Canard Orphanage and bring me his granddaughter. She was practically raised in his lab. If anyone knows the code, she does. After we get the code, then she can have an accident [laughs] like her grandfather. I trust you can get the order right this time!

Gosalyn: [recites] It's a trackiospecific device that disrupts gravitational bonds on a molecular level allowing manipulation on a macro scale.

Darkwing: Looks like you two were close.
Gosalyn: [sadly] We were. [crosses arms] But he never told me any code!
Darkwing: Unfortunately, Taurus Bulba doesn't know that. His men will be searching for you, you know. [chuckles] Although if they knew how much spirit you have, they'd probably run the other way.
