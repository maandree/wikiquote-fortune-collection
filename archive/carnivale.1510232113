Samson: Before the beginning, after the Great War between Heaven and Hell, God created the Earth and gave dominion over it to the crafty ape he called Man; and to each generation was born a creature of light and a creature of darkness; and great armies clashed by night in the ancient war between Good and Evil. There was magic then, nobility, and unimaginable cruelty; and so it was until the day that a false sun exploded over Trinity, and Man forever traded away wonder for reason.

Brother Justin Crowe: Latter day versions of the vile plagues that rained on Egypt, the fires that consumed Sodom and Gomorrah, scourges of the Old Testament, yes, but even now brothers and sisters, even now, droughts and pestilence fester in the very heart of this great land. Titanic sandstorms, the likes of which man has not seen since the days of the prophets. And I ask myself, what are these things? What are they if not evidence of God's fury? What are they if not harbingers of the Apocalypse? And yet And yet as I walked to church today, these troubled thoughts were soothed by a balmy wind. And as I looked out upon the endless acres of rich, untilled earth, I realized brothers and sisters, that this is truly the Promised Land, and that we are indeed blessed. But let us not forget the less fortunate. Let us not forget that they too were once blessed. And let us not forget that the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.

Brother Justin Crowe: Yes, that old time religion, brothers and sisters, rising like a phoenix from the ashes of sin and degradation. Where there was a den of flesh and debasement, there is now a glorious, shining temple dedicated to the Lord God Almighty! Amen. Now there were those who laughed when we started our great mission, men of the cloth, respectable learned men, who said the migrants had lost their faith. He said that the migrants believed that God has abandoned them. And so they in turn have abandoned God. Well to them I say, who has more faith in God than those who have borne witness to His Fury? Who has more faith in God than the brother who has seen his land blow away in a raging tempest? Who has more faith in God than the sister who has buried her children in the hardscrabble left behind? Who has more faith in God than the families that wander the wilderness in search of the Promised Land? From Kansas to Colorado! From New Mexico to Oklahoma!

Ben Hawkins: No, that ain't my place.
Management: If that is true, my friend, then why is such a choice possible? Why are you not like other men, left behind to bury your dead, gnash your teeth and cry out to God, "Why her, Lord, why not another?" The answer is self-evident. It is your place, Ben Hawkins; it cannot be escaped. It can only be accepted… Her life for another's. It is the only way… You may go now.

Samson: On the heels of the skirmish men foolishly called the War to End All Wars, the Dark One sought to elude his destiny, live as a mortal. So he fled across the ocean, to an empire called America. But by his mere presence, a cancer corrupted the spirit of the land. People were rendered mute by fools who spoke many words but said nothing. For whom oppression and cowardice were virtues, and freedom… an obscenity. And into this dark heartland, the prophet stalked his enemy, till, diminished by his wounds, he turned to the next in the ancient line of Light. And so it was that the fate of mankind came to rest on the trembling shoulders of the most reluctant of saviors.
