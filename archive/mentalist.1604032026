Next time you see me, [taps Raquel gently on the knee] when I say hello you'll remember that good feeling and you will want to tell me the truth.

Lisbon: No.
Jane: Palm Desert's not in California?
Lisbon: No, you can't sneak off and talk to Sonny Battaglia.
Jane: Oh, I thought you meant Palm Desert wasn't in California. It is in California, right?

Jane: I'm finished talking with you.
Sonny Battaglia: What are you, Al Pacino all of a sudden? People don't act that way with me.
Jane: I do when there's witnesses around.
Sonny Battaglia: What are we gonna do with this guy? He's got a screw loose.
Jane: You think you have a certain charm about you, and you do, but you live by oppression. In reality you're just a greedy, twisted little sadist.
Sonny Battaglia: Hey, screw you blondie. You're lucky you helped me beat Arnold Palmer here or I'd plug you right now. To hell with the witnesses.

Pattrick Jane: The truth hurts, I know. It's biologically based actually. Our brains process sound faster than they do light, but light moves faster than sound. So the brain is constantly shifting reality so the world syncs up.
Doc Dugan: What does that have to do with anything?
Patrick Jane: This. Only when someone is standing 30 yards away do we see and hear the world exactly as it is. That's when your brain, sound and light are all in perfect harmony.
Doc Dugan: So?
Patrick Jane: The rest of the time we are living in a world of lies. Lies are what make the world make sense. Ergo, the truth hurts.

LaRoche: Well I can't make a case, but you chose a remote location for the meeting, you set up a situation in where Moss had to flee. And there, by chance, was Risgby.

Lisbon: Moss didn't have to run, I would have brought him in.

Lisbon: What? We followed the evidence.
Jane: You, you did. Follow the evidence.
Lisbon: Okay. I was wrong. But we followed the evidence!
Jane: You know what gave me second thoughts about Elise Vogelsong? She read too many murder mystery novels.
Lisbon: There you go. That's not police work. That's guessing.
Jane: You should try it sometimes. Now I'm gonna pursue Red John. Ciao!

Lisbon: Bertram is bringing Homeland into the Lorelai murder... Did you hear me?!
Jane: Yes.
Lisbon: Now that she's killed someone they're gonna start looking again into her escape.
Jane: That's likely.
Lisbon: Jane. I know you broke her out of prison. And you know I know.
Jane: And I know you know I know.
Lisbon: This is not funny! If they find out you could be charged as an accomplice to murder.
Jane: Well, if they find out. They won't, unless of course you sing to the coppers.
Lisbon: Which I won't, and that makes me an accomplice to murder as well.
Jane: Well only if you look at it as a very persnickety lawyer.
Lisbon: She tortured someone!
Jane: Yes. It's, it's horrible, I know. But she must have had good reason.
Lisbon: God, can you hear yourself?!
Jane: Yes, I can hear myself! Julia Howard must have helped murder Lorelai's sister. Must have been there with Red John. Lorelai wouldn't do this otherwise. I trust her.
Lisbon: ...Jane. I am your partner, not her. You need to be honest with me.
Jane: I know.
Lisbon: If she contacts you, if you find anything out about her, if you have any insights about the case...
Jane: I will tell you.

Lisbon: You're putting your trust in the mistress of a serial killer. She's playing you.
Jane: Playing me? How?
Lisbon: You're blind. You're involved with her, it's clouding your judgement.
Jane: There's no involvement. I feel nothing for her.
Lisbon: Now you're really lying! ...I will make this very simple. I will not be a part of this and neither will you if you want to remain on the team.
Jane: An ultimatum? Someone is playing a little too much poker... I confess. I may have some feelings, but if I have crossed any lines it is not because I like her. I will do anything I can to get to Red John, but you have known that since the start.

Bertram: When it comes to Lorelai Martins I don't think Jane can be trusted.
Lisbon: I don't know if that's true.
Bertram: He's admitted to a sexual relationship with her. Then Martins kidnaps him and they spend days alone together. Don't you ever wonder what went on between them?

Jane: Alright. I'll go talk to Buddy Hennings, love doctor, and you check out the shady bakery.
Lisbon: Van Pelt and Rigsby can handle it. I'll go to the radio station with you.

Jane: Your brow is furrowed and you have that squinty look in your eye. You want to talk to me about the whole foot fetish thing that the catholic school girl in you tells you it's not necessarily appropriate.

Jane: I mean, "fetish" is a strong word, but everyone has that thing. It's just human nature.
Lisbon: I don't.
Jane: Oh come on Lisbon. Don't deny yourself that freedom. There's definitely something out there that works for you, something that flips your switch. Like turtlenecks.

Barlow: Red John's got powers. Real psychic powers that you refuse to believe in. Teresa will hear what I'm saying, but you've no faith, so you're deaf to the truth. He's got powers. That's why he'll always defeat you.
