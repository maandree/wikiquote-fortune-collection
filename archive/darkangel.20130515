Max [voiceover]: They used to say one nuclear bomb can ruin your whole day. It was sort of a joke, until the June morning those terrorist bozos whacked us with an electromagnetic pulse from 80 miles up. You always hear people yapping on how it was all different before the pulse. Land of milk and honey blah, blah, blah, blah with plenty of food and jobs and things actually worked. I was too young to remember, so, whatever... The thing I don't get is why they call it a depression. I mean, everybody's broke, but they aren't really all that depressed. Life goes on.

Overnight, the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.

Max: I knew this would happen. We shouldn't have taken the chance.
Logan: We had to. You know we did. We can't keep going through this though.
