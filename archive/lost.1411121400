Kate Austen: You don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.
Jack Shephard: Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac. Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I … And the terror was just so … crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count: One, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.
Kate Austen: If that had been me, I think I would have run for the door.
Jack Shephard: No, I don't think that's true. You're not running now.

Which means that there's a mother nearby. A 250 pound rat, with scimitar like tusks, a surly disposition, who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything that comes near it. Boar's usual mode of attack is to circle around and charge from behind so I figure it'll take at least three of us to distract her long enough for me to flank one of the piglets, pin it and slit its throat.

John Locke: Ludovico Buonarrati, Michelangelo's father. He was a wealthy man. He had no understanding of the divinity in his son, so he beat him. No child of his was going to use his hands for a living. So, Michelangelo learned not to use his hands. Years later a visiting prince came into Michelangelo's studio and found the master staring at a single 18 foot block of marble. Then he knew that the rumors were true -- that Michelangelo had come in everyday for the last four months, stared at the marble, and gone home for his supper. So the prince asked the obvious -- what are you doing? And Michelangelo turned around and looked at him, and whispered, sto lavorando, I'm working. Three years later that block of marble was the statue of David.

John Locke: My sister, Jeanie, died when I was a boy. Fell off the monkey bars and broke her neck. And my mother, well, my foster mother, she blamed herself, of course. She thought she wasn't watching close enough. So, she stopped eating, stopped sleeping. The neighbors started talking, afraid she might do something to herself, I guess. [Sipping coffee] Oh, that's good. Anyway, about 6 months after Jeanie's funeral, this golden retriever comes padding up our driveway, walks right into our house, sits down on the floor, and looks right at my mother, there on the couch. And my mother looks back at the dog. After about a minute of this, of them both staring at each other like that, my mother burst into tears. Beautiful dog, no tags, no collar, healthy, and sweet. The dog slept in Jeanie's old room, on Jeanie's old bed and stayed with us until my mother passed 5 years later. Then, disappeared back to wherever it was she came from in the first place.
Kate Austen: So, you're saying the dog was your sister?
John Locke: Well, that would be silly. But my mother thought it was, thought that Jeanie had come back to tell her the accident wasn't her fault, let her off the hook.

That's why the Red Sox will never win the damn series. I have a son who's about your age. He's not like me, he does what's in his heart. He's a good man, maybe a great one. And right now, he thinks that I hate him. He thinks I feel betrayed by him. But what I really feel is gratitude, and pride because of what he did to me. What he did for me. It took more courage than I have. There's a pay phone over here. I could pick it up and I could call my son. I could tell him about all this. I could tell him that I love him. One simple phone call and I could fix everything.

Martha Toomey: Sam and Leonard were stationed at a listening post monitoring long wave transmissions out of the Pacific. Boring job. Sam hated it, nothing to do but listen to static night after night. Until one night, about 16 years ago, there's something in the static, a voice comes through, a voice repeating those numbers over and over again. [Hurley nearly spills his tea.] A couple of days later we're at the fair in Kalgoorlie and some wally there has got this jar, must have been big as a pony, and it's filled to the rim with beans. Fella's offering 50 grand to anyone able to guess how many beans are in that jar, within 10.
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: Sam used the numbers?
Martha Toomey: Yep, the answer was exact. To the bean. Men had been running the same scam for 40 years and nobody had ever come close. So we won the money. On the way home a pick-up truck blows a tire on the highway, hits us head on. Lost my leg that night.
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: What about Sam?
Martha Toomey: Barely a scratch. Most people would consider themselves lucky, but not him. He was never the same after that. He started keeping a record. Anything terrible that happened to anyone around us, he believed it was all because he used those numbers. He moved us out here in the middle of nowhere hoping it would stop.
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: Did it? Did he ever find a way to make it stop?
Martha Toomey: Yep. He put a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. What is it you're looking for Mr. Reyes?
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: I used them, the numbers, to win the lottery. And now I think I'm under the same curse.
Martha Toomey: Curse? There's no curse.
Hugo "Hurley" Reyes: But you just told me...

Locke: That's why you and I don't see eye-to-eye sometimes, Jack -- because you're a man of science.

Locke: Me, well, I'm a man of faith. Do you really think all this is an accident -- that we, a group of strangers survived, many of us with just superficial injuries? Do you think we crashed on this place by coincidence -- especially, this place? We were brought here for a purpose, for a reason, all of us. Each one of us was brought here for a reason.

Mr. Eko: For a brief time, I served in a small parish in England. Every Sunday after mass, I would see a young boy waiting at the back of the church. Then one day, the boy confessed to me that he had beaten his dog to death with a shovel. He said the dog had bitten his baby sister on the cheek and he needed to protect her. And he wanted to know whether he would go to hell for this. I told him that God would understand, and that he would be forgiven, as long as he was sorry. But the boy did not care about forgiveness. He was only afraid that if he did go to hell that the dog would be there, waiting for him.

But the first piece of land I saw wasn't Fiji, was it? No. No it was here... this, this island. And you know why? Because this, is it. This is all there is left. This ocean and this place here. We are stuck in a bloody snowglobe! There's no outside world! There's no escape! So, just go away, huh. Let me drink.

Desmond: I'd ask you how the hell did you know something like that?
Locke: I found another hatch—another station on the Island. They called it the Pearl, and I saw a film there—an orientation film. And it said that everything that was happening in our hatch wasn't real—that it was a test—a psychological experiment.

Locke: You're wrong.

Locke: I'll figure something out. For all you know I was a commander in the Navy. Put your arm around my neck and I'll lift under your knees.
Ben: What's in the pack, John? If you met Mikail that means you were at the communications station, which means you found the explosives. So you're not planning on piloting the submarine anywhere, you're planning to destroy it. I know you, John Locke.
Locke: You don't know me at all.
Ben: I know you were born in California. I know that you were raised in foster care. I know that you wasted a big part of your life in Tustin, pushing papers at a place that manufactures industrial boxes.

Ben: I was born on this island; not many of my people can say that. Most of them were recruited and brought here, and as much as they love this place, as much as they would do anything to defend it, they need to know that they can leave if they want to. The sub maintains that illusion.
Locke: So you're lying to them?
Ben: No... they're here because they want to be here. Some of them are just not ready to make a full commitment yet. But you John, you've already made that commitment. And now you have a choice, because if you stop and think, I can show you things. things I know that you want to see very badly. Let me put it so you'll understand: picture a box. You know something about boxes, don't you John? What if I told you that somewhere on this island there is a very large box and whatever you imagined, whatever you wanted to be in it, when you open that box, there it would be. What would you say about that John?
Locke: I'd say that I hope that box is big enough for you to imagine up a new submarine.
Ben: Why are you so angry John?
Locke: Because you're cheating. You communicate with the outside world whenever you want to, you come and go as you please, you use electricity and running water and guns. You're a hypocrite. You don't deserve to be on this island. If you had any idea what this place was you wouldn't be putting chicken in your refrigerator.
Ben: You have been on this island for 80 days, John. I have been here my entire life. So what makes you think you know this island better than I do?

Your father's dead, your wife left you, moved on with another man. Can you just not wait to get back to the hospital? Get back to fixing things? It's twenty seconds now. Just get me the phone, Jack.
Jack: No.
Ben: Ten seconds. Bring me the phone.
Jack: No.
Ben: I'm not bluffing!
Jack: I WON'T DO IT!
Ben: Five. Four. Three.
Jack: No.

Ben: I'm so sorry, Jack.

Jack: Tom are you there?
Tom: Yeah, Jack, I hear ya.
Jack: I'm going to lead my people up to the radio tower. And I'm going to make a call and get them all rescued. Every one of them. And then I'm gonna come find you. And I'm gonna kill ya.

Kate: So why did you bring him back? Why didn't you just kill him?

Jack: She helped us, John. All you ever did was blow up every chance we've had of getting off of this Island! You killed Naomi.

Kate:[Just arriving] Yes he did. She just died. She didn't give you up, John. She covered for us, and she fixed this.[Hands Jack the phone] They're on their way.

It's the only place on the Island with any form of security, so it'll have to do until I can think of something else. Until then, if you wanna live, you need to come with me.

Worker: Right... Okay, so what? We're gonna go back and kill Hitler?
Pierre Chang: Don't be absurd. There are rules. Rules that can't be broken.
Worker: So what do you want me to do?

We called them the Others, and they started attacking us. And we found some hatches, and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or... well, I was never really clear on that. But... the Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches. That was the DHARMA Initiative. The Others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us. And then we teamed up with the Others because some worse people were coming on a freighter. Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us. So we stole their helicopter and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up. And we couldn't go back to the island because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean, and we floated there for a while until a boat came and picked us up.

[1974 - Sawyer and Juliet step out of some foliage to find Daniel Faraday kneeling alone and crying in the jungle.]
Daniel: [muttering] Not gonna tell... I'm not gonna tell...
Sawyer: [whispering to Juliet] Where's Red?
Juliet: I dont know.
[Juliet walks over to Faraday and stoops down to talk to him. Sawyer, Miles and Jin hang back.]
Daniel: [mutters indistinctly] No. I won't do it. I won't tell her. I won't do it. Won't...
Juliet: Daniel? Are you okay?
Daniel: I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna tell her.
Juliet: Daniel, where's Charlotte?
Daniel: [Voice breaking] She's not here. She... She's gone.
Juliet: Where?
Daniel: She's... dead. She's dead. There was another flash, and... and she was... she was just gone.
[Juliet nods sympathetically.]
Daniel: Her... body just... [crying] disappeared. She moved on, and we stayed.
Juliet: I'm so sorry.
Sawyer: Hold on. Wait a minute. We "stayed"? We're not traveling through time anymore? You saying it's over?
Daniel: Of course it's over. Wherever we are now... whenever we are now... we're here for good. :[To Juliet, or perhaps to himself] I won't do it.
Juliet: Okay. Okay.
Daniel: I won't. I'm not gonna--I'm--I'm...
Juliet: Okay.
Daniel: I'm not gonna--I w--I won't.
Juliet: Okay. [pats Dan on head] Okay.
[Juliet stands up and goes back towards Sawyer]
Daniel: ...Tell...
Sawyer: Okay. Swell. Until Dan checks back in, I say we head back to the beach. When Locke gets back with everybody, that's where they'll be looking for us.
Miles: The beach? What, you didn't get enough flaming arrows shot at you? And your camp is gone. Why bother?
Juliet: Sawyer's right, Miles. We should go back to the beach. We survived there before. We can do it again.
Miles: [To nobody in particular] Or maybe when we get there, you'll--you'll wanna go back to the Orchid again. And then when that gets boring, we can head back to the beach. It's the only two plans you people have.

Sawyer: I got good news and bad news. What you want first?
Horace: Good news.
Sawyer: You're a daddy. Bad news is you missed it.
Horace: Oh, gosh. Amy... She had the baby?
Sawyer: It's a boy.
Horace: A boy?
[Sawyer shakes his head "Yes"]
Sawyer: Now how about you tell me... why you're too busy drinking and blowing up trees to see him be born?
Horace: I was, uh... I was looking for a pair of socks, and all of mine were dirty, so I went to grab a pair of Amy's, and... I found this... In the back of her drawer.
[He shows Sawyer Paul's necklace]
Horace: It was Paul's.
Sawyer: You got in a fight over a necklace?
Horace: I know. But... It's only been three years, Jim. Just three years that he's been gone. Is that really long enough to get over someone?
Sawyer: I had a thing for a girl once. And I had a shot at her, but I didn't take it. For a little while, I'd lay in bed every night, wondering if it was a mistake. Wondering if... I'd ever stop thinking about her. And now I can barely remember what she looks like. I mean, her face... it's.. She's just gone, and she ain't never coming back. So... Is three years long enough to get over someone? Absolutely.

Frank: What about him?
Co-Pilot: He’s one of the Oceanic 6. The guy must have nerves of steel, man. He survives a full on commercial airliner crash now he’s flying over the same South Pacific.
Frank: Yeah, well. Maybe he doesn’t believe lightning will strike twice in the same place.

[Sawyer throws Jack some 1977 style clothes including a shirt and a pair of trousers]
Jack: You want us to say we came in on the sub? How’s that going to work?
Sawyer: Everyone gets knocked out before the trip, so no one meets each other until we process ‘em.
Jack: Look. We need to find the rest of people from the plane.
Sawyer: If there was a plane then Jin will find it. So we’ve got about ten minutes to make intake or you’ll be camping in the jungle for a long time. There isn’t another batch of recruits due in for six months.

Jack: Whaddya think?

Sawyer: What can I do for you, Jack?
Jack: I don't even know where to start. Uh... How about with Sayid?
Sawyer: I had no choice. He was running around in the jungle, got caught by my people. And seein' as how he can't tell the truth about how he got here, I had to improvise.
Jack: Improvise?
Sawyer: Aha. And for now, Sayid is safe, which is all that matters.
Jack: So where do we go from here?
Sawyer: I'm working on it.
Jack: Really? Because it looked to me like you were reading a book.
[Sawyer smiles]
Sawyer: I heard once Winston Churchill read a book every night, even during the Blitz. He said it made him think better. It's how I like to run things. I think. I'm sure that doesn't mean that much to you, 'cause back when you were calling the shots, you pretty much just reacted. See, you didn't think, Jack, and as I recall, a lot of people ended up dead.
Jack: I got us off the island.
Sawyer: But here you are... Right back where you started. So I'm gonna go back to reading my book, and I'm gonna think 'cause that's how I saved your ass today. And that's how I'm gonna save Sayid's tomorrow. All you gotta do is go home, get a good night's rest. I do what I do

The Man in Black:[Disguised as Locke] Hello, Jacob.
Jacob:...Guess you found your loophole.
The Man in Black: Indeed, I did. And you have no idea what I've gone through to be here.
Ben: You two know each other?
The Man in Black: In a manner of speaking. Do what I asked you to, Benjamin.
Jacob: Benjamin, whatever he's told you, I want you to understand one thing: you have a choice.
Ben: What choice?
Jacob: You can do what he asks, or you can go, leave us to discuss our... issues.
Ben: Oh... so now, after all this time... you've decided to stop ignoring me. Thirty-five years I lived on this island, and all I ever heard was your name, over and over. Richard would bring me your instructions, all those slips of paper, all those lists... and I never questioned anything. I did as I was told. But when I dared to ask to see you myself, I was told, "You have to wait. You have to be patient." But when he asks to see you, he gets marched up here as if he was Moses. So why him? Hmm? What was it that was so wrong with me? What about me?
Jacob: [spitefully] What about you?
Ben: ...Ah. Well... [He stabs Jacob twice in the chest and watches as he falls to the ground]
Jacob:[Quietly] They're coming...
The Man in Black: What? I can't hear ya.
Jacob: They're coming!
[With this, The Man in Black looks alarmed. He then kicks Jacob into the fire and he and Ben watch him burn]

Juliet: There's nothing to talk about, James. We have to let Jack do what he came here to do.
Sawyer: Well maybe you should have told me about your change of heart before I brought him out to the jungle to kick his ass!
Juliet: Would that have stopped you?
Sawyer: No -
Juliet: Well, then, I'm glad you got it out of your system.
Sawyer: Hey! Ju - [He makes to grab her]
Juliet: [She pulls away] No, James, don't you -
Sawyer: [He backs off, shocked] ...I need you to tell me where all of this is coming from. One minute you're leading the Great Sub Escape and now you're on board with blowing up the damn island?!
Juliet: I -
Sawyer: I got a right to know why you changed your mind.
Juliet: ...I changed my mind when I saw you look at her.
Sawyer: I don't care who I looked at. I'm with you.
Juliet: ...And you'd stay with me forever, if I let you, which is why... I will always love you. And we knew what we had was just for a little while, and - and just because we love each other doesn't mean that we're meant to be together, so if... if Jack can make it so that you guys never come here, then... he should.

Hurley: Where you going dude? Whats going on? Why are you here? I mean you show up in LA, in the back of a cab and tell me to get on that plane that just so happens to get me back to the island. How did you know that would happen?

Hurley: You want me to do something crazy again don't you?

Jacob: Jack cannot save him. You have to take Sayid to the temple, the rest of them should be safe there too.
Hurley: The temple? Am I supposed to know where that is?
Jacob: Jin knows. Ask him to take you to the hole in the wall where he was with the French team. Through that opening you can gain access to the temple.

Ben Linus: What are you?
The Man in Black:[disguised as John Locke] I'm not a "what", Ben, I'm a "who".
Ben Linus: You're the monster.
The Man in Black: Let's not resort to name calling.
Ben Linus: You used me. You couldn't kill him yourself, so you made me do it.
The Man in Black: I didn't make you do anything. You should know, he was very confused when you killed him.
Ben Linus: I seriously doubt that Jacob was ever confused.
The Man in Black: I'm not talking about Jacob. I'm talking about John Locke. Do you want to know what he was thinking while you choked the life out of him, Benjamin? What the last thought that ran through his head was? "I don't understand." Isn't that just the saddest thing you've ever heard? But it's fitting in a way because when John first came to the island, he was a very sad man. A victim shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do, even though they were right. He was weak and pathetic, and irreparably broken, but despite all of that, there was something admirable about him. He was the only one of them who didn't want to leave. The only one who realized how pitiful the life he left behind actually was.
Ben Linus: What do you want?
The Man in Black: Well that's the great irony here, Ben, because I want the one thing that John Locke didn't. I want to go home.

Jack: They lost my father.
Locke: I'm sorry?
Jack: He died a couple of days ago in Australia, and I flew down to get him.
Locke: My condolences. [screaming to Oceanic employee handing him his lost luggage form] Yo!
Jack: The coffin was supposed to go on the plane in Sydney, but it didn't. Apparently he is somewhere in transit, which is their way of saying that they have no idea where the hell he is.
Locke: Well, how could they know?
Jack: They're the ones who checked him in. I mean, they have to have some kind of tracking system.
Locke: No, I'm not talking about the coffin. How could they know where he is? They didn't lose your father, they just lost his body. [Jack ponders this as Locke smiles at him] Either way, your story beats the hell out of mine. All that was in my suitcase was a bunch of knives.
Jack: Some kind of salesman?
Locke: Yeah, something like that. Well, it was nice talking to ya, but I hope you find that coffin.
Jack: I hope you find your knives.
Locke: Thanks.
Jack: You mind if I ask what happened to you? I'm only asking because I'm a spinal surgeon. I didn't mean --
Locke: No, don't worry about it. Surgery isn't going to do anything to help me. My condition is irreversible.
Jack: Nothing is irreversible. [hands him his card] If you ever want a consult, just give me a call. It's on the house.

The Man in Black: What I am is trapped. And I've been trapped for so long that I don't even remember what it feels like to be free. Maybe you can understand that. But before I was trapped, I was a man, James. Just like you.
Sawyer: I'm havin' a hard time believin' that...
The Man in Black: You can believe whatever you want, that's the truth. I know what it's like to feel joy... to feel pain, anger, fear... to experience betrayal.

Daniel: Do you believe in love at first sight; Mr. Hume?
Desmond: Excuse me?
Daniel: The first time I saw her, I was walking through this museum a few weeks ago. She... she works here. She was on the lunch break. She was eating a chocolate bar. She has these incredible blue, blue eyes, red hair. And as soon as I saw her, right... right in that moment, it was like... it was like I already loved her. And that's when things got weird.
[Daniel search out in his bag and takes a book off]
Daniel: That same night after I saw that woman... I woke up and I wrote this.
Desmond: So what is it?
Daniel: I'm a musician. I have no idea. So I took it to a friend of mine at Caltech. He's a math whiz. He said this is Quantum mechanics. He said these equations are so advanced that only someone who'd been studying physics their entire life could've come up with them.
Desmond: So... so what do they mean?
Daniel: Okay, imagine... imagine something terrible is about to happen, something catastrophic. And the only way to stop it from happening was by... releasing a huge amount of energy. Like setting off a nuclear bomb.
Desmond: You wanna set off a nuclear bomb?
Daniel: Just listen. What if this... all this... what if this wasn't supposed to be our life? What if we... we had some other life and for some reason, we changed things? I don't want to set off a nuclear bomb, Mr. Hume. I think I already did.
Desmond: Listen, mate, um... I don't know what any of this has to do with me. So...
Daniel: Why did you ask my mother about a woman named, Penny? It happened to you too, didn't it? You felt it.
Desmond: I don't know... I don't know what I felt.
Daniel: Yes, you do. You felt love.
Desmond: That's impossible because I don't know anything about this woman. I don't know... I don't know where she is. I don't even know if she exist. She's... She's an idea.

Jack: No, what bothers me is I have no idea what the hell you are.
The Man in Black: Sure you do.
Jack: Why John Locke?
The Man in Black: Because he was stupid enough to believe he had been brought here for a reason. Because he pursued that belief until it got him killed. And because you were kind enough to bring his body back here in a nice little wooden box.
Jack: And he had to be dead before you could look like him?
The Man in Black: That's right.
Jack: And who else have you looked like?
The Man in Black: Jack, what do you really want to ask me?
Jack: Our third day here, I chased my father through the jungle, my dead father. Was that you?
The Man in Black: Yes, that was me.
Jack: Why?
The Man in Black: You needed to find water. Jack, I know this must be hard for you to understand, but all I've ever tried to do is help you.
Jack: To "help me?" To do what?
The Man in Black: Leave! But because Jacob chose you you were trapped on this Island, before you even got here. Now Jacob's dead, we don't need to be trapped here. We can get on a plane and fly away anytime we want.
Jack: If we could just get on a plane and fly away, why would you even still be here?
The Man in Black: Because it has to be all of us.

The Man in Black: What?
Jack: John Locke was the only one of us who ever believed in this place. He did everything he could to keep us from leaving this Island.

Ben: The DHARMA Initiative hasn't existed in almost 20 years.
Hector: That's not true. We still get a teletype before every drop.
Ben: It's automated. Comes from the Lamp Post station in LA. There hasn't been a person posted there since you two started. That's why the man in charge has me going around, closing up shop.
Glenn: Lamp Post station?
Ben: [smiles] I've already said more than I should've. Before you leave, please lock the doors, turn out the lights.
Hector: Wait. You can't just walk out of here. We deserve answers!
Ben: All right. Before I go, I'll let you each ask a question. But just one. So, make it count.
Glenn: Where have we been sending these palettes? Where are they dropped?
Ben: An Island.
Glenn: How's that possible? The coordinates are different every time.
Ben: The Island moves.
Glenn: [scoffs] How does the Island--
Ben: Uh-uh! One question. [to Hector] Your turn.
Hector: We're on Guam. So this Island is somewhere in the tropics, right? [He fetches a box] So explain this. Polar bear biscuits. How is there a polar bear on a tropical Island?
Ben: Polar bears, actually. Plural.
Dr. Chang: Hello, I am Dr. Pierre Chang. This is the orientation video for station one of the DHARMA Initiative, the Hydra. For purposes of security, please do not divulge my name to any outside parties. [he smiles] I wouldn't want to have to resort to using an alias in the future. The chief purpose of this station is to conduct biological and behavioral research on various animal, bird and marine subjects. Here are some of the duties you may be asked to perform. [A caged bird shrieks behind him] Genetic alteration. These fascinating hybrids, or "hy-birds" as we call them, will be released and monitored to see how they adapt to the unique properties of the Island-- successful advanced studies in larger mammals. Ursus maritimus, or polar bears, possess a keen sense of memory and adaptability. These traits make them ideal candidates for electromagnetic studies that will be conducted at a secondary site where their comfort in cold temp-- It's important when dealing with the bears that you do not show affection or become attached in any way. Also, do not underestimate their intelligence and cunning. These rules must always be followed. I repeat, the bears are not your friends. Rewarding the bear with a fish biscuit, once it has successfully performed a complex puzzle. After the training is completed, you will tranquilize the bear. Affix this tracking device around the subject's neck. At which point it will be transported to the Orchid station for the next phase of research. Remember, be sure to confirm that the female bears have not been impregnated before transport, as the electromagnetic levels at the Orchid have an extremely harmful effect on early term gestation. As you've already learned, we do animal research here at Hydra. Unfortunately, one must consider the most dangerous animal of all, humans. And so, there is another more secluded test site, where we are conducting significantly more sensitive work. The Island's indigenous population, some of you may have heard them referred to as "Hostiles", are acquired on the main Island, sedated and brought here, to Room 23. Because the subjects are unwilling participants, security personnel should always be present during these sessions. Under no circumstances are you to engage subjects in conversation. The purpose of these interrogations is to better understand the Hostiles' way of life, their origins, and particularly their worship of an Island deity they refer to as "Jacob". After the research team has concluded their tests, inject this into the back of the subject's neck. Then place these goggles over his or her eyes. Hitting this switch will commence the visualization while the drugs take effect. [shouting over the film music] The dream-like quality of the film combined with the cutting edge pharmaceuticals will create an amnesia of sorts. Any memory of his or her interrogation will be effectively wiped clean. While these interrogative measures may seem extreme, rest assured, they are vital...our temporary truce with the Hostiles is not violated. This concludes your orientation of the Hydra station. Do not discuss the nature of these experiments with other members of the Initiative. Enjoy your time here on Hydra Island. Namaste and good l--

Ben: Hello, Walt.
Walt: What are you doing here?
Ben: Like my note said, a friend of yours sent me.
Walt: I don't have any friends.
Ben: We all have friends. Even me.
Walt: You here to kidnap me again?
Ben: I'm genuinely sorry about that. But what's done is done. I can't change the past. I can only take responsibility for it. Walt, I understand what you've had to go through. I know the difficulties you've had pretending to be someone you're not.
Ben: Walt, I'm here to help you.
Walt: Why?
Ben: Because you're special. And I bet nobody's told you that in a very long time.
Walt: What good does that do me?
Ben: We need you. You have work to do. Starting with helping your father.
Walt: My father's dead.
Ben: Doesn't mean you can't help him. Will you go with us, Walt?
Ben: Come on, it's OK. You ride shotgun.
Hurley: Dude.
Walt: Hurley.
Hurley: It's great to see you, Walt.
Walt: I kept hoping one day somebody would come back for me. They said I was crazy.
Hurley: You're not crazy, dude. Not even close. You just need to get back to the Island, that's all. It's where you belong. It's where you've always belonged.
Walt: Why?
Hurley: I wanna talk to you about a job. All right, Ben, let's get out of here. It's time for us all to go home.
