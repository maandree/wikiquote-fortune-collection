Jack: I met Karen's mother. She's not dead. She's a cocktail waitress. It turns out Karen's father died when she was seven. Oh, my God. Can you imagine what Karen looked like when she was seven years old? Cute little pumps, cute little martini, cute little pills. Ah-ha-ha. Anyway, from then on they moved around a lot until Lois met a man, a ne'er-do-well named Bernie. Or was it Todd? I don't know. I can't remember, 'cause at that point I zoned out 'cause some real hot fireman came into the bar. Oh, his name was Todd. That's right. Hot Toddy. Hot Toddy. Hot Toddy. Anyway, what did I do with his number? Actually, when Karen was 16, her and her mother had some big falling-out, and Lois wouldn't tell me what it was; but I have a feeling Karen killed a man with her bare breasts. All this is in my movie. I smell sequel.

Jack: Karen, that wasn't you, that was the opening scene of Speed!

Jack: Hey, Kare. What's the story, drunken whorey?
Karen: Well, we need to do something to get Will and Grace back together. Honey, it's been almost two years.
Jack: Well, why does it always fall on us to help those two?
Karen: I know, poodle. Ya know, sometimes it seems like our sole purpose in life is just to serve Will and Grace.
Jack: Right! It's like all people see when they look at us are the supporting players on the Will and Grace Show!
Karen: Though, to be fair, we couldn't have our own show. We're good for poops and giggles, but it'd get silly after awhile.
