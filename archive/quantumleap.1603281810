Sam: You're not just a bartender.
Bartender Al: That's true. I own the place, too.
Had he leapt into Jimmy, and truly been a person who had a handicap, or was retarded, then I don't know what we'd have been accomplishing with that. Sam might have learned something out of it, but he learned something leaping in and being himself and being perceived as being a retarded person. And that means that people see you as something, and they treat you like it, and they don't give you the chance to be who you could be. And that's a part of what we're talking about, part of what we're trying to change.
So the idea is not that he really is that person. That never was the concept. The concept in my head was that when he leaped in, people saw the aura of the person he leaped into. It's a little bit like, if I came up here in the beginning of this thing as I did, and I somehow hypnotized you all, and instead of Scott Bakula being up here, because he was down working on the show, I had Michael Zinberg, who's a producer, come up and sit down here, and you all saw him as Scott Bakula. That's what happens on the show. It's only when you look in a mirror do you see, do we see, does Scott see, what everybody sees around him. But I think that holds true.
And I hope, I think that's also interesting; because he can leap in as a very old man that everyone can perceive cannot do anything, and he can be quite physical, and shocks people when that happens. Or he can leap in as a man his age; he's not very old, but he can be trying to perform as a boxer who's twenty years old, and [it's] tough to do. So he is then handicapped in that situation by his limits. So that's the way we script it."Don Bellisario Hitchcock Theater "8 1/2 Months" screening of 2/25/91:
