Lisbon: Oh, right. Bosco's so in love with me that he'll do whatever I say.
Jane: Yes. Yeah. It's a little farfetched. He does love you. How could he not? But he's not the type to bend his principles over love. So I figure it's something more concrete. You must have something on him.
Lisbon: You think?
Jane: Yes. Something he did wrong. Something very bad that you know about. Now he's not the type to steal or do drugs, so my guess? He hurt someone. He killed him. A bad guy that he couldn't catch any other way.
Lisbon: No.
Jane: Yes and you helped him do it. No. You found out after the fact and you let him off the hook because the bad guy deserved it.
Lisbon: No.
Jane: I'm touched that you would risk your career over me. That means a lot to me.

Alexa Schultz: I understand the CBI has hired a new consultant, a man named Patrick Jane?
Minelli: Yes. I'm surprised you know, I didn't realise you followed our hiring that closely.
Alexa Schultz: Mister Jane is connected to a case we're interested in. The serial killer known as Red John. I'm, ehm, calling to ask a favour.
Minelli: What's that?
Alexa Schultz: I would appreciate updates on the Red John case. That way when my boss asks me what's going on, I have something to tell him.
Minelli: To put it bluntly Alexa, why would I do that? What's in it for me?
Alexa Schultz: Well it's useful to have a friend in the FBI, isn't it? And I'm a good friend.
Minelli: Well, I'm a great believer in interagencies cooperation. I don't see why we couldn't engage in some.

Rigsby: Go ahead. Say it. Now you're supposed to say "say what?". And I say "you think I'm an idiot for buying Van Pelt that orchid". You know what? I'm glad I did. Cause now the ball's in her court. I'm gonna be so zen about this. The move's hers. I'm gonna be the reed that bends in the breeze.
Cho: You're still in love with her. But instead of telling her, you bought her a plant.

Lisbon: He has a talk show, "Prescriptions for love with Buddy Hennings". What? I listened to it in my car a few times.
Jane: Alright. I'll go talk to Buddy Hennings, love doctor, and you check out the shady bakery.
Lisbon: Van Pelt and Rigsby can handle it. I'll go to the radio station with you.
Jane: Ah, that's because you're fan!
Lisbon: I am not! I just think he's a viable lead.

Jane: Your brow is furrowed and you have that squinty look in your eye. You want to talk to me about the whole foot fetish thing that the catholic school girl in you tells you it's not necessarily appropriate.
Lisbon: You're right. I don't get it. I can't wrap my head around it.
Jane: I mean, "fetish" is a strong word, but everyone has that thing. It's just human nature.
Lisbon: I don't.
Jane: Oh come on Lisbon. Don't deny yourself that freedom. There's definitely something out there that works for you, something that flips your switch. Like turtlenecks.
Lisbon: You're right. It's inappropriate. Good night!
Jane: Turtlenecks it is.

Rigsby: The Tupperware's a clue. Why hide something in Tupperware?
Lisbon: I don't know. Keep it fresh?
Van Pelt: Nothing stays fresh for nine years.
Lisbon: Well, maybe LaRoche needed a box, and the Tupperware was handy.
Rigsby: No. Tupperware's never handy. It's always in the wrong drawer.
Van Pelt: And when you do find it, the lid's always missing.

Jane: Two years ago, I hired a petty thief to break into LaRoche's safe for a list of Red John suspects.

Barlow: Red John. Any punk killer who wants to fool with you can paint a smiley face on the wall. "Ooh, it's Red John"
Jane: It was Red John.
Barlow: Red John has your mind completely messed up. You see him every place you look. You think you're getting closer, but he is just playing with you.
Jane: We'll see.
Barlow: Has it never occurred to you to ask exactly how Red John is always one step ahead of you? How is it he seems to read your mind?
Jane: You tell me.
Barlow: Red John's got powers. Real psychic powers that you refuse to believe in. Teresa will hear what I'm saying, but you've no faith, so you're deaf to the truth. He's got powers. That's why he'll always defeat you.
