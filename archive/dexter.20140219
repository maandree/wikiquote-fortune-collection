Dexter: I just know there's something dark in me. I hide it. Certainly don't talk about it. But it's there. Always. This … Dark Passenger. How when he's driving, I feel … alive. Half-sick with the thrill, complete wrongness. I don't fight him. I don't want to. He's all I've got. Nothing else could love me, not even … especially not me. Or is that just a lie the Dark Passenger tells me? Because, lately, there are these moments that I feel connected to something else. Someone. It's like … the mask is slipping, and things, people, that never mattered before, are suddenly starting to matter. It scares the hell out of me.

I think Harry knew that from the start. That's why he gave me a code. It cost him his life, but it kept me alive through incredible trials. The code is mine now, and mine alone. So too are the relationships I cultivate.
They're not just disguises anymore. I need them. Even if they make me vulnerable. My father might not approve, but I'm no longer his disciple. I'm a master now. An idea transcended into life.
And so this is my new path. Which is a lot like the old one, only mine. To stay on that path I need to work harder, explore new rituals, evolve. Am I evil? Am I good? I'm done asking those questions. I don't have the answers. Does anyone?

Debra: They're looking for someone named Kyle Butler who's a friend of Arthur Mitchell's. They think if they can find him, then he can lead them to Mitchell.
Quinn: But they can't find him?
Debra: Well, not yet. They're having sketches done. They're trying to get a positive ID.
Quinn: Kyle Butler. Why does that name sound so familiar?
Debra: Well, that's the weird thing. We worked that case, remember? A dead Kyle Butler...
Quinn: Right, he got his head smashed in. Went unsolved...any connection?

Boyd: Let me the fuck out of here.
Dexter: I bet you've heard that before, "let me out of here", from all the women you've killed. I wish you could see the room I set up for you. But you fucked everything up, Boyd. All those pictures I took of the woman you killed - it's a shame you'll never get to see them. I'll just have to paint a word-picture for you instead. They were young, just starting their lives... Now they're floating in formaldehyde and stuffed into barrels strewn around a swamp.
Boyd: Who the hell are you?
Dexter: Just a fellow traveler, who also likes to pick up dead animals.
Boyd: I did them a favor. They were all suffering and I put them out of their misery.
Dexter: Yeah, you'll be doing one more favor tonight.
Boyd: What are you talking about?

Debra: Yeah. And I think it was worth it cos I think I'm starting to figure it out. I went through Cole Harmon's contacts. And do you remember that weird plastic-wrap murder a few weeks back - those two guys at the warehouse?
Dexter: Yeah, one of them was a dentist.
Debra: A kids' dentist. Dan Mendell. Well, it turns out he and Cole are buddies. They fucking poke each other on Facebook. And you see that ring on the DVD? It matches photos taken at the warehouse crime scene. So, I think he's one of these guys. So, Dan the dentist is dead. He was shot to death. Looks like somebody attacked Cole Harmon in his house. And Boyd Fowler's disappeared. This is a group of guys that like to get together and they like to do this for fun. So, what else do they have in common? They're all missing. But they're not on the run, I can tell you that. Not one of them bought a plane ticket, or emptied their bank account or used a fucking credit card. Someone is taking these guys out.
Dexter: Who?
Debra: Well, at first I thought they were turning on each other. Then I thought, "That doesn't make sense. Why would they do that after all this time?" So, I started asking myself, "Who would want to take these guys out?" And you know the first person that came to mind? Me.
Dexter: You?

Still, I'm curious - how do you justify arresting me and not him? Or is the law just something you make up as you go along? Turning a blind eye whenever you feel like it or Dexter is involved.

Saxon: [chuckles] That may have been a little over the top, but I was trying to make a point.
Dexter: I missed the point.
Saxon: It was a test, to see if, this time, she would finally choose me. Well, we both know how that turned out.
