Amanda: I feel awful...so I assume that your showing up here is not a coincidence?
Pete: (resignedly) Probably not. Look I'm sorry, Amanda, but it looks like we're dealing with a bit more of the old...(rocks hand back-and-forth)
Amanda & Pete: (in unison)...boogedy-boogedy.
Amanda: Great. What is it this time?
Pete: I'm not really sure, but...(Amanda wipes her forehead with her sleeve)...Are you OK?
Amanda: I'm feeling worse by the minute. (sips from a bottle of water)
Pete: You do look a little sweaty.
Amanda: Hmm...thank you. I was going for sweaty. Hoping for puffy later.
(Pete notices that the bottle of water Amanda has just put down is actually boiling)

Amanda: Pete, am I gonna be all right?
Pete: (confidently) Yeah. I'm here, OK, we're gonna fix it.
Amanda: Never really thought of you as the fix-it kinda guy. You were always much more the break-it kinda guy.
Pete: I know, right? Who'd have thought my life would get weirder after I quit drinking?

Pete: (via the Farnsworth) Mykes, hey, are you OK?
Myka: There is something definitely wrong with Tracy. Her eyes are doing this weird...thing and then she gave me this-this tea and... (sees open canister of drain-cleaner on the counter) ...Oh my God, I think my sister tried to poison me.
Pete: Wow, you said your family was competitive but...Jeez!
Myka: No! It's obviously an artefact - I just have no idea what I'm looking for.
Pete: Same here. Amanda was whammied by something in a leather box, but I can't find anything.
Myka: Is she OK?
Pete: Well, she's super-hot.
Myka: Yes, Pete, I've met her, but if you could just set that aside for a moment?
