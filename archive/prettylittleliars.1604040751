Alison: Being a leader of girls.. that hasn't worked out well for me.
Ashley: What happened to you, in that room ?
Hanna: He just played games with us.
Ashley: What kind of games ?
Hanna: Truth or dare. Who do you love more, me or her ? Who deserves water today, you or somebody else ? You decide or you lose your turn and somebody else gets to pick.
Toby: When I caught Andrew, I wanted to take him apart because of what he did to you.
Toby: We got the son-of-bitch. Andrew.

Spencer: Our familiers are connected. They're more than just connected they're tangled up like necklaces int the bottom of you jewelry box.
Andrew: Oh, you'll graduate. The school wants you gone as much as the rest of us. You'll graduate with honors.
Andrew: Other towns have nice toxic dumps. Rosewood has you.
Spencer: Don't do that.
Veronica: Don't do what ?
Spencer: Don't try to catch me in a lie. It's humiliating.

Hanna: Unless you're texting me the answer, you're rude.
Hanna: Okay, first you're sexting Toby like some dog in heat, and then you're gumming at your desert like my grandman. How long do you want that cookie to last ?

Aria: Hanna, you're bleeding.
Hanna: What ? Where ?
Emily: What do you mean where ? Where Dr. Amateur cut your neck open.

Aria: Well, then fill the ballroom with police. It's fairy-tale themed. They could come as the village idiots.
Spencer: I wrote about what it means to support someone unconditionally even when they haven't been entirely honest with you. How everybody needs somebody to be inspired by. Someone who sets the bar really high. Someone who will put somebody else's needs before their own and then not resent them for it. Who always expects you to do the right thing but forgives you when you don't.
Toby: Well, I think your mom would be pretty moved by that.
Spencer: Yeah, she might be. But I wrote it about you.
Veronica: It wasn't bad enough that this bitch tried to steal my husband. But her sicko son had to bury her in our backyard !!
Hanna: Wait. Lucas took Jenna to the prom ? Seriously ?!
Spencer: She's tipping him. She probably thinks he Uber-ed her there.
Ella: What was that ? Was that thunder or music ?
Ashley: That was probably Hanna parking..
