Juliet: Where are you off to, Frank?
Frank: Ah, nowhere! Just... Thought maybe you could handle things from here.
Juliet: You know, it's funny. After Mom kicked you out and changed all the locks on the doors, I always wondered how you would sneak into my room, and leave little gifts on my nightstand. And eventually, I just figured out that you are really good at taking apart a window and putting it back together. In an out. Like a ghost.
Frank: I don't know what you mean, Jules.
Juliet: God, you are such a coward.
Frank: There's no need for that.
Juliet: Actually, there's a long overdue need for it. Your life has been so starved of honesty, that the second you feel it creeping around the corner, you are out the nearest door.
Frank: I'm sorry you feel that way.
Juliet: It's not a feeling, Frank. It's the truth. [Frank turns to walk away.] I'm not done. [Frank stops and turns back toward Juliet.] Look, I don't know if you've realized this, but I'm not a kid anymore. And I am not going to sit around and waste my time, and my tears, on missed recitals and birthdays, but what really breaks my heart... Is that you won't be there for all the moments to come.
Frank: We don't know that, Juliet.
Juliet: Yes, I do. Because that's my choice. And I don't want you there.
Frank: You don't mean that.
Juliet: Sadly, I mean every word. Because I feel cheated. I feel robbed. So congratulations, Frank. Your longest con of all was on your own daughter.
