Samson: Before the beginning, after the great war between Heaven and Hell, God created the Earth and gave dominion over it to the crafty ape he called Man. And to each generation was born a creature of light and a creature of darkness. And great armies clashed by night in the ancient war between good and evil. There was magic then, nobility, and unimaginable cruelty. And so it was until the day that a false sun exploded over Trinity, and man forever traded away wonder for reason.

Brother Justin: Latter day versions of the vile plagues that rained on Egypt, the fires that consumed Soddom and Gomorrah. Scourges of the old testament, yes, but even now, brothers and sisters, even now drought and pestilance fester in the very heart of this great land. Titanic sandstorms, the likes of which man has not seen since the days of the prophets… And I ask myself, "What are these things? What are they, if not evidence of God's fury? What are they, if not harbingers of the apocalypse?" And yet… and yet, as I walked to church today, these troubled thoughts were soothed by a balmy wind. And as I looked out upon the endless acres of rich, untilled earth, I realised, brothers and sisters, that this is truly the promised land and that we are indeed blessed. But let us not forget the less fortunate. Let us not forget that they too were once blessed. And let us not forget that the lord giveth, and the lord taketh away. Amen.

Brother Justin: Eleanor, I see you in my sermons, and you pray so hard it breaks my heart. But my words, they wash over you like water over a stone. We all, each of us, carry within us the seeds of our own salvation and our own damnation. You do belive that, don't you?

Management: You must act as a man, not a boy. A boy mends the broken bones of his playmates, and resurrects little kittens for his own amusement. This is different, this is a woman's life. A human life. To restore it you must take life… with deliberation. You must choose the life you take — that is the way of our kind.

Management: You have made this choice before.
Ben Hawkins: What do you know about that?
Management: I know that you are capable of making such a choice. Capable of saying "this one deserves to live, this one deserves to die".
Ben Hawkins: No, that ain't my place.
Management: If that is true, my friend, then why is such a choice possible? Why are you not like other men, left behind to bury your dead, gnash your teeth and cry out to God, "Why her, Lord, why not another?" The answer is self-evident. It is your place, Ben Hawkins; it cannot be escaped. It can only be accepted… Her life for another's. It is the only way… You may go now.

Samson: On the heels of the skirmish men foolishly called the War to End All Wars, the Dark One sought to elude his destiny, live as a mortal. So he fled across the ocean, to an empire called America. But by his mere presence, a cancer corrupted the spirit of the land. People were rendered mute by fools who spoke many words but said nothing. For whom oppression and cowardice were virtues, and freedom… an obscenity. And into this dark heartland, the prophet stalked his enemy, till, diminished by his wounds, he turned to the next in the ancient line of Light. And so it was that the fate of mankind came to rest on the trembling shoulders of the most reluctant of saviors.
