(Philip is telling Will and Carlton about his freshman year at Princeton)
Philip: For extra money, I had to work for the Princeton Daily. My first assignment was to interview the town's most famous stripper: Boom-Boom Lasalle.
(The guys start laughing)
Will: I wonder why they called her that.
Philip: For some reason, she took a liking to me. So she invited me to come with her and her sister to her dressing room for drinks.
Will: You the man, Uncle Phil.
Philip: Anyway, one thing led to another and before you know it, this old country boy...(Vivian slams a plate of food on the table in front of him) finished his Yoo-Hoo and went right home.
Vivian: Wait a minute, Philip. Go back to when you finished your Yoo-Hoo.
Carlton: (after their school goes coed) It's a disgrace. It's a scandal. It's an outrage.(a girl walks past him) It's the mother of my children.

Will: Ooh, Veronica, I like that.
Veronica: Great, now I can die.
Will: Whoa, whoa, whoa, now, baby, I noticed you noticing me and I just want to put you on notice that I noticed you too.
Veronica: And?
Will: And I just want to let you know that I might let you consider being with me.
Veronica: Is that what passes for a compliment?
Will: Wait, listen...
Veronica: No, you listen. If you want a shot at being with me, maybe you should try talking to me like a normal human being. Got it?
Will: Actually, baby, you got it, but I'll take donations!

Will: YO, THAT AIN'T NO WOMAN THATS MY COUSIN!!!
Ashley: I am too a woman and I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my business!
Will: Don't you shake your neck at me like that, girl!
Ashley: Come on, Kenny!
Kenny: Hey.

Carlton: AND DON'T SHAKE THAT EITHER!

Ashley: Wow!
Will: Dude sounds like a jackass.
Carlton: Actually, Will, he sounds like you.
Ashley: So when are we going out?
Kenny: Oh, I don't know, baby. You have to let me check my book and I'll get back to you. You see, I wanna make sure I can give you my undivided attention.
Carlton: Actually Will, he's better than you.
Kenny: I mean look at you. You got it going on. You got sweet hips, lips and finger tips. (a beautiful girl walks by) But baby got back! (to Ashley) Bye, baby. (while running towards the other girl) Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute!

Will: Carlton, I think you know what you have to do.
Carlton: I know, but still, I would have like to have been there for Ashley. (runs after the beautiful girl)
Ashley: Kenny ran after that girl.
Will: Kenny is a different case.
Ashley: Carlton ran after the same girl.
Will: Well, Carlton is a basket case.

Philip: I want to talk to you about something. It's about my daughter posing for your magazine. Now, suppose your daughter got involved in this whole world?
Hefner: My daughter is involved in this whole world. She runs the Playboy empire.
Philip: OK, well, then lets say someone you really care about... like your wife. Suppose she decided to pose?
Hefner: Well, my wife was the playmate of the year and I'm very proud of that.
Philip: Don't you understand there are some parents who aren't comfortable with their daughters being stared at by millions of people?
Hefner: I understand. Over the years, I've had to deal with a lot of parents. You seem like a decent man. I promise you: the pictures will be tasteful.

And you might wanna mention the fact that we have been denied due process: A phone call, access to legal representation and every other conceivable right guaranteed to us by the constitution. Don't forget to mention that no statements have been taken no witnesses interviewed, and none of the most fundamental procedures that the newest rookie on a beat would know, have been followed. My nephew and I are completely innocent, and if you don't take care of this it will be you having your picture taken with numbers across your chest!
