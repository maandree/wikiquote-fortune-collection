(September 27, 1996)
Sabrina: Morning.
Zelda: Good morning. Happy birthday, Sabrina.
Hilda: And many more to come.
Zelda: Many, many more to come. I, ah, got you a little something. [picks up a wrapped box and brings it over to the table]
Hilda: Actually, that’s from both of us; I just forgot to sign the card.
Zelda: [hands the birthday present to Sabrina] I hope you don’t already have one.
[Sabrina opens up the box excitedly and pulls out...]
Sabrina: [put out] A black pot? Actually, I don’t. Thanks...
Zelda: It’s a cauldron.
Sabrina: Wow, even better. I can, um, put my pens in it...
Zelda: That’s not what it’s for. Sabrina, we have something to tell you. You see there are two realms, the natural and the supernatural and it turns out the immutable laws of physics-
Hilda: [interrupting] You're a witch.
Sabrina: [surprised] What do you mean, I’m a witch?
Hilda: You’re a witch.
Zelda: Now you're not alone. I’m a witch, Hilda’s a witch, your father’s a witch...
Sabrina: [skeptical] And I suppose my mom’s a witch too?
Hilda: I always thought so.
Zelda: Actually, your mom’s mortal. You see, that’s why you’re here; so that we can teach you to use your magic.

[Zelda places a large, old, leather bound book in front of Sabrina]
Zelda: Here is a present from your father.
Sabrina: An old book, a black pot - Doesn’t anyone shop at The Gap anymore? [reading the cover] "The Discovery of Magic"... Why’d he give me this? [opens the book to a page depicting a picture of a bearded man in a top hat, labeled Edward beneath it] That’s why! This old magician looks just like my dad.
[The picture turns to look at her]
Ted: Surprise! [Sabrina gives a little start] It is your dad! Happy birthday, Sabrina!
Sabrina: [amazed] Wow, Hallmark has gone really high tech! Can he say anything else?
Ted: I’m not a hologram, honey - I’m just in a different realm.
Sabrina: A different realm? I thought you were at the Toronto Midway Motor Lodge.
Ted: [to his sisters] Zelda, Hilda, didn’t you explain to her she’s a witch?
Hilda: [to the book] She doesn’t believe us!
Sabrina: [exasperated] Not this again... [closes the book] Look, I know you went to a lot of trouble to set this joke up, so... Ha-ha-ha, now it’s over?
Hilda: No. It’s just beginning. You are a witch.
Zelda: With real magical powers, and now that you're sixteen, you can use them. [bemused] And you wanted something from The Gap..
Sabrina: So, what are you saying? that I’m not who I think I am? You’re not who I think you are? And my father lives in a book?
Hilda: Oh, finally, she gets it!
Sabrina: This is insane, I’m going to my room. [gets up and heads for the door] Come on, Salem.
Salem: Can you wait till I've finished my milk?
Sabrina: [stops, shocked] Did the cat just talk?
Salem: Yes, and get this stupid hat of my head.
Sabrina: [horrified] Oh my God! [runs away]
Zelda: I think we’d better let her father handle this... Ted?
[The book levitates of the table and goes after Sabrina]

Ted: [voice muffled by the pages] Sabrina, open me up!
Sabrina: No!
Ted: We have to talk, young lady! Open me up this instant!
Sabrina: No! I don’t want to talk to a book. Oh God, I’m talking to a book! [opens the book] I can’t be a witch! Witches don’t exist!
Ted: Honey, I know this is hard, but you just have to accept it. You’re not like other kids - you’re special.
Sabrina: I don’t wanna be special, I wanna be normal!
Ted:I understand, but... that ship has sailed.
Sabrina: None of this makes sense. I mean, all these years, I thought you were travelling with the Foreign Service!
Ted: I am; It’s just a lot more foreign than you thought.
Sabrina: And Mom? Has she really been digging for fossils in Peru?
Ted: Yes, she is.
Sabrina: Then I wanna go live with her.
Te: You can’t. You see, there’s a rule: If you set eyes on your mother in the next two years, she’ll turn into a ball of wax.
Sabrina: What?!
Ted: It’s the way they discourage Mortal-Witch marriages.
Sabrina: So, is that the reason you and Mom got divorced?
Ted: No.
Sabrina: [hopeful] So, d’ya think maybe you could get back together?
Ted: No - that’s another ship that’s sailed. [Sabrina deflates] You’re going to be fine. Just take some time, and think about all this. And, if you ever need me, I’m in the index.

Sabrina: I’m a witch and I still have to go to school?
Zelda: M-hm.
Sabrina: Unfair. [deviously] Hey, maybe I’ll turn Mr. Pool into...
Hilda: Now! Now! Be careful pointing your finger at people, it could be way too dangerous!
Sabrina: You're pointing at me, so isn't that dangerous?
Hilda: [smiles] I have the safety on, of course.

Harvey: Can I sit here?
Sabrina: Sure.
Harvey: [eases into his seat] How’s your head?
Sabrina: Um, it kinda hurts.
Harvey: Sorry, y’know, I didn’t mean to hit you with the football...
Sabrina: Oh, that was you? [Harvey nods] You have a really good arm.
Harvey: [smiles] Thanks.
Sabrina: [gestures to Jenny] Do you know Jenny?
Harvey: You live in the house with the funny mailbox, right?
Jenny: Oh, it’s not our fault; The people who lived there before us were actually named Mr. and Mrs. Hog.
Harvey: No, it’s cute! My mailbox is boring, it’s really just a place to put letters...
Sabrina: Mine too!

Sabrina: I hate being a witch! I just turned the most popular girl in school into a pineapple!
Hilda: Why?
Sabrina: Because it’s the only thing you taught me how to do!
Hilda: Relax, I can fix this. [takes the pineapple and grabs a knife] Chunks or rings?
Zelda: Hilda, there are other ways.
Hilda: Wedges?
Zelda: Sabrina doesn’t know how to seal her spells yet, so... [Hilda reluctantly puts down the knife and stands back] "The popular girl is not a fruit." [the pineapple morphs back into Libby] There, all better.
Libby: What am I doing in your house?
Sabrina: [unconvincingly] You... came over for a visit.
Libby: Ha, I would not'! You did something to me, you sent me somewhere - It was small and it smelled like Hawaii!
Sabrina: [apologetic] Look, Libby, I’m sorry, I didn’t-
Libby: Oh, not as sorry as you will be! You’re an even bigger freak than I thought, and the whole school’s going to know about it! [runs away]
Hilda: See? My way, she’d be on a tooth-pick.
Sabrina: It’s over! My life is over! I mean, it’s not just over, it’s over, over!
Zelda: Oh stop, Libby can’t hurt you. She’s just one person with a crazy story.
Sabrina: She’s a cheerleader - nobody has more credibility! I mean, the only way to make this better is to turn back time, and you said a witch can’t do that!
Zelda: A witch can’t, but collectively we do have powers that a single witch doesn’t. It’s a union thing.
Sabrina: [hopeful] So, it’s possible?
Zelda: You can appeal to the Witches Council, but they only grant time reversal in extreme cases.
Hilda: Like for two months, a bunny ruled all of England.
Sabrina: [confused] When?
Hilda: See?

	-- Sabrina, the Teenage Witch - Pilot
%
Sabrina: Salem, do you think the council will grant the time reversal?
Salem: I'm the wrong witch to ask. They weren't very lenient with me. Sentenced to a hundred years as a cat. And for what?
Sabrina: I don't know. For what?
Salem: Oh, like any young kid, I dreamed of world domination. Of course, they really crack down when you act upon it.
Sabrina: Wow. No wonder you're so possessive of the sofa.
Salem: Mmm. It would've been glorious; Me, as the firm, but just, Emperor of Earth - Trust me, being a house pet wasn't even "Plan B".
Sabrina: Come on, it's not that bad. You take 5,000 naps a day.
Salem: I can't go dancing. I can't play squash. The sound of the can opener is the only thing that makes me feel truly alive.
Sabrina: Salem? Would you like your rubber mouse?
Salem: ...Please.

Sabrina: I love being a witch! I don’t know what made the Council change their minds, but I got to do the whole day over again, and now the teachers think I’m smart, the jocks think I’m cool- Oh, and I’m going to the movies with Harvey and Jenny Saturday night! Woo-hoo! I’m normal! Gotta go tell the cat! [runs up the stairs]
Hilda: [shakes her head, bemused] Teens.
Zelda: What about them?
Hilda: Just in general.

Sabrina: Hey, is there something funny about our names?
Libby: Not Jenny’s.
Sabrina: You know, why don’t you guys just leave us alone? We’re not bothering you.
Libby: You’re still breathing, aren’t you, freak? [To Jenny] Double freak!
[Libby and C.C walk away, laughing]
Sabrina: [To Jenny] We can’t let her get to us, [slams her locker shut in frustration] it’s what she wants. I just wish I knew what she was saying...
Jenny: Well, what difference does it make? Everything Libby says is a lie.
Sabrina: Hey, maybe we can retaliate by spreading lies about her.
Jenny: What can we say? That she’s actually nice and sweet?
Sabrina: Not much revenge in that...
Jenny: No. Face it, the world’d be a much better place if everyone told the truth - but you can’t stop someone from lying.

Zelda: Hey Hilda, have you seen the Jiffy Truth?
Hilda: Yeah, it’s in my bag. [goes over to it] I used it last week when I took my car in for repairs; It turns out I really did need new break pads. [pulls out a box of sprinkles and hands it to Sabrina]
Sabrina: [reading box] "Jiffy Truth: one hundred percent refined truth, trace amounts of harsh reality. For best results, sprinkle on something sweet as the truth can be bitter."
Hilda: It is great stuff, it makes you reveal your true feelings. Oh, which reminds me: Zelda, the postman has a crush on you.
Zelda: [annoyed] That is not what the sprinkles are for! They should only be used in serious matters.
Sabrina: Well, this is serious; You remember Libby? Well, she’s been spreading lies about me and Jenny and... it’s really upsetting Jenny.
Hilda: Well, give Libby some sprinkles, and if those don’t work... [pulls out a plastic aerosol bottle from her bag] ..try some Lady Bald Spot. You just spray it, and-
Zelda: Hilda, that’s enough! Sabrina, you can take the sprinkles, but let me warn you: the truth can have painful side effects.
Sabrina: Like what?
Zelda: Itching, chafing, hurt feelings.
Sabrina: Sounds like gym class.

Libby: [smiling slightly] Really?
Sabrina: And sprinkles.
Libby: Oh, all right. [takes the plate] But I’m not going to start being nice to you.
Sabrina: That’s okay... [Libby takes a bite of the cake] I just want to ask you one question: Libby, what have you been saying about Jenny and me behind our backs?
Libby: Like I’d tell you! [swallows cake, and sprinkles' magic kicks in] Okay, here’s what I was saying: I was saying that your father’s in jail and that you cheats on taxes, and then I threw in that you had a nose job.
Sabrina: But those are all lies!
Libby: You don’t have to tell me!
[Jill and C.C. approach]
C.C.: What’s going on?
Libby: I was just telling Sabrina all the rumours we’ve been spreading about her.
Jill: Why? She’s not in the loop!
Libby: So? [to Sabrina] And by the way, it was Jill who made up the nose job story. Which is actually very funny, because er, she’s the one who... [taps her nose meaningfully]
Jill: [gasps] You swore you’d never tell!
Libby: ...And C.C., she kisses her Pete Sampras poster every night...
C.C.: You snitch!

Just gather round the Jack-O-Lantern and remember: the true meaning of Halloween is inside you. Right Salem?

Leonard: Well, it looks like my posse has just baled on me. Say, do you buffalo gals wanna come out tonight?
Sabrina: Er, I’m sorry, are you inviting us to a saloon?
Leonard: No. I’ve got this condo for the holidays, and Cole and James just baled on me. I don’t suppose you ladies would be interested in a little winter getaway? Condo’s got a hot-tub.
Sabrina: [to the others] That could be fun!
Morgan: Excuse me, Sabrina, the last thing that we want to do is go freeze our butts off on some mountain.
[The girls head for the door]
Leonard: Mountain? No, no, the condo’s in Miami.
[All three of them stop in their tracks]
Sabrina: Miami?
Roxie: Florida?
Morgan: America?
Leonard: Eighty degrees and sunny.
[delighted, the girls form a conga-line]
Girls: [singing] Going to Miami!Going to Miami!Going to Miami!Going to Miami!

Sabrina: [to Morgan] Okay, you go and distract Roxie.
Morgan: Okay. [beat] How?
Sabrina: Haven't you ever distracted anyone before?
Morgan: Well, yeah, but I don't think Roxie's gonna fall for the "Ooops, my strape broke!" trick.
Sabrina: It's worth a shot. [pushes her towards Roxie]

Annie: That’s it? Nobody has a story idea?
James: Annie, it’s been kind of a slow week. I mean, no rappers got arrested, no movie stars were hospitalised for “exhaustion”...
Annie: Come on! A new trend, a new band, there must be a story we haven’t done?
Sabrina: Okay, last night on National Superstars- [notices James and Cole sneering] ...Which I only watched because my roommates made me... They announced they’re gonna do their next show in Boston. I mean, maybe we could do a story on that?
Cole: That show is so lame.
[Sabrina joins in with the general mutters of agreement]
James: Seriously, I cannot believe people watch that junk.
[long pause]
Cole: There’s no way Clay should have won, okay? Tania was so much better!
Leonard: Tania was hot! Rosie O’Donnell hot!
Annie: Okay, you all gotta get a life. [to Cole] Clay rocks.

All but Sabrina: Harmony, Harmony, Gosh we're feeling' swell....
Sabrina: I guess the musical notes on the label should have tipped me off. Well, at least we're not arguing anymore...
All but Sabrina: Harmony, Harmony, Gosh we're feeling' swell!Harmony, harmony, this is going' oh so well!
Shirley: Imagine my delightto meet you here tonightand endlessly enumerate the reasons you're not right! My boy says you're the one,when all is said and done,you simply are not good enough to wed my perfect son!
Aaron: It steams me seeing Harvey standing next to you.It seems that Harvey's more than just an ex to you.
Sabrina: Oh yeah? [takes a bite of crab cake with Harmony salt and sings] I love the ring, but, heyI'd love to hear you sayHow many other fiances you've dumped along the way!
Morgan: Harmony, harmony, can't conceal the bile.Harmony, harmony, this is gonna take a while!
Roxie: [dances with Bob] Your power plants and toxic dumps are perilous.
Bob: Your room-mate's confrontational and querulous.
Sabrina: Perhaps it would be bestTo not offend our guestso zip your lip and give your hippie politics a rest!Harmony, harmony, this was not my plan.Now we're all meaner than when this stupid song began!
All: There's nothing like a good old-fashioned melodyTo put a little gloss on animosity!Slinging mud with effervescent charm!Drawing blood while singing arm in arm!And all in perfect harmony!
Bob: [goes down on one knee with arms out] In case you didn't hear it;
All: Knock-down drag-out harmony!
