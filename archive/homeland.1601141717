Saul: What were his exact words, please?
Carrie: An American prisoner of war has been turned.
Saul: He said this in English?
Carrie: Yes, he whispered it into my ear right before the guards pulled me away.
Saul: Why would he use the expression "turned"?
Carrie: He mentioned turned, working for Abu Nazir.
Saul: Why am I just hearing about this now?
Carrie: Because until ten minutes ago, I didn't know there were any POWs alive in Iraq or Afghanistan.
Saul: So you're suggesting that Abu Nazir planted intelligence on his own safehouse just so we could recover Sergeant Brody?
Carrie: I realize it sounds like a reach.
Saul: To say the least. Why not just drop him near a checkpoint and make it look like he escaped? Why would you sacrifice thirteen trained fighters?
Carrie: Because Abu Nazir is playing the long game. This way no one suspects a thing.
Saul: Except you.
Carrie: Yeah, except me!
