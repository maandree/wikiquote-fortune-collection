Come home from work and see their stereo is still there. Hear about some murder in the barrio, find out the next day the police caught the guy. If having all those things means some cop roughed up some nigger or some spic in the ghetto...well, as far as most people are concerned it's don't ask, don't tell.

Vic: Oh, Brothers all about his thick. Better go easy on that juice, D. Your brains turn into hot sauce, shrinks the balls to raisins. Oh... sorry, I'm too late.
Damon: My brain's fine-tuned, and them balls are the size of cat heads.

Vic: The edge is where we live, all of us, all the time. People trying to convince themselves otherwise is just an exercise in self-deception.

Vic: During a raid on a drug dealer named Two-Time... I... shot and killed Detective Terry Crowley.
Olivia: Y-you— you killed a police officer?
Vic: I planned it, and I carried it out. I shot him once just below the eye. Our Strike Team was committing criminal acts on a regular basis. At first it was just taking drugs from busts, turning it around, and selling it for profit. We were able to do this by making partnerships with local drug dealers and gangs, you know, that we knew we could leverage.
Olivia: You son of a bitch.
Vic: I killed Crowley to protect me and my guys. I shot him with Two-Time's gun to divert suspicion, but Aceveda knew. So did Kavanaugh—the I.A.D. Investigator who was after us. They just couldn't prove it. I was too good.
Olivia: Is that it?
Vic: [about the recorder] How much memory does that thing got?

Vic: I want my deal, but I need a favor. It's not for Ronnie. It's for my ex-wife. I got her into some trouble. She was trying to protect me today, and she did something that might be construed as aiding and abetting.
Olivia: Might be construed?

Claudette: [ in the Barn's interrogation room.] You heard about Shane. What he did to his pregnant wife, his young son. He wrote a note.
[Claudette produces the suicide note. Vic remains silent.]
Claudette: [reading] "I guess enough painkillers can make even the worst kind of hurt go away. The thing you need to know is that Mara was innocent, and Jackson was innocent. They didn't know what they were drinking, and their last moments together were happy ones. They left the way I first found them, perfect and innocent. They were innocent; they're in heaven now, and we'll always be a family. [Pauses] The guilty ones are me and Vic. Vic led, but I kept following. I don't think one's worse than the other, but we made each other into something worse than our individual selves. I wish I'd never met him. I see it all now, there's no apologies I can make, no explanations I can give. I was who I was, and I can't be that person anymore. I can't let myself..."
[Vic's expression has changed to show his distress.]
Claudette: We think this is where he was when we came in, because it stops there. All those busts...all those confessions you got in this room, illegal or otherwise...all the drugs you got off the street tonight for ICE...you must be very proud of yourself.
[Vic's expression is emotionless. He remains silent.]
Claudette: This is what the hero left on his way out the door.
[Claudette produces the photos of Shane and his family. She places them on the table, glares at Vic, and leaves.]
