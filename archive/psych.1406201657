Shawn: They tell me I got something called Narcissistic Personality Disorder. But, uh, the truth is this lustrous hair and dimpled chin are merely chapter one. I'm a veritable cornucopia of high-octane maladies, such as outrageous intelligence syndrome. And a little obsessive successful disorder.
Lavender McElroy: Goodness. I've never encountered a patient who suffers from so many diseases that don't exist.
Shawn: Well, they, uh they exist where I come from.
Lavender McElroy: And where is that?

Juliet: Then why are you still wearing them?
Shawn: The inner lining is so soft. I think it's Alpaca. Maybe baby muskrat. You gotta check this out.
Gus: I don't want to, Shawn.
Shawn: You're gonna be sorry.
Gus: Fine. Wow, they are supple. Try it, Lassie.

Shawn: What? What are you telling me? That you're a Kenny G. fan?
Gus: A little bit, yes. This song.
Shawn: I gotta be honest, I've never minded this song either.
Gus: So you know that's right.
Shawn: It's really really smooth.

Juliet: Where are you off to, Frank?
Frank: Ah, nowhere! Just... Thought maybe you could handle things from here.
Juliet: You know, it's funny. After Mom kicked you out and changed all the locks on the doors, I always wondered how you would sneak into my room, and leave little gifts on my nightstand. And eventually, I just figured out that you are really good at taking apart a window and putting it back together. In an out. Like a ghost.
Frank: I don't know what you mean, Jules.
Juliet: God, you are such a coward.
Frank: There's no need for that.
Juliet: Actually, there's a long overdue need for it. Your life has been so starved of honesty, that the second you feel it creeping around the corner, you are out the nearest door.
Frank: I'm sorry you feel that way.
Juliet: It's not a feeling, Frank. It's the truth. [Frank turns to walk away.] I'm not done. [Frank stops and turns back toward Juliet.] Look, I don't know if you've realized this, but I'm not a kid anymore. And I am not going to sit around and waste my time, and my tears, on missed recitals and birthdays, but what really breaks my heart... Is that you won't be there for all the moments to come.
Frank: We don't know that, Juliet.
Juliet: Yes I do. Because that's my choice. And I don't want you there.
Frank: You don't mean that.
Juliet: Sadly, I mean every word. Because I feel cheated. I feel robbed. So congratulations, Frank. Your longest con of all was on your own daughter.
