Buck Nasty: Look Silky, he done pulled out a whip.Silky Johnston: Nice whip. This here is a pistol. Reach for the sky, honky!Slave: Honky? HONKY?Silky Johnston: "Honky" is a racial epithet used for white people. It was made popular by a man named George Jefferson in the 1970s. You see, he and his wife, Weezie, owned a dry-cleaning business, so they moved on up to the east side, to a deluxe apartment in the sky. They finally got a piece of the pie. Convoluted story I'll admit, but the point is this... that in the future, all black people will be FREE!Slave: When's we gonna be free?Silky Johnston: That is a good question my man. How about now-ish? <shoots the slave owner, the scene is repeated 3 times>gh
