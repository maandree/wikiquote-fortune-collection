As I was trying to tell the Lama while I'm very grateful he agreed to pray for Hubbell, I was actually hoping he would do it here. At the memorial on Monday. Or Tuesday. We're flexible about the day. Could you ask him again? Because I already have a monk in Ireland who said he'd pray from there. But I was really looking for someone to represent, as the kids say. What if I throw in a trip to Disneyland? Does he have a friend who's not busy chanting for the Japanese people? All right.
Fanny: [To Michelle] What is it about these monks? How hard is it to get on a plane? Well, at least he said he'd pray for him.
Michelle: That's nice.
Fanny: He can say anything he wants. He's on another continent. How do I know he's really doing it? - Well, he is a monk.

Carl: Carl [they shake hands]. I didn't know you could just change the rules.
Boo: I didn't know you could just change them either.
Sasha: There were never rules.
Carl: Well, if there are no rules, I'm sitting here. Don't mind me. Just keep doing what you're doing.
Roman: Good luck with that. [Dez sits down next to Melanie]
Melanie: What the hell?!
Dez: Whatever. Just saw these guys here so I figured "hey."
Sasha: Impeccable logic.

Michelle: We got the community board to sign off on the amphitheater, so we're good to go.
Talia: Well, congratulations.
Michelle: My first pantsuit victory. And I have to say, at first, I was all against the whole concept, but now I get it. It's binding, so it keeps all your powers in. Plus, there's no potential "Basic Instinct" moment. So suddenly you're not thinking about how you're sitting and you'd be surprised how much brain space that frees up. Plus, the pockets. Dance clothes never have any pockets, but this suit has pockets everywhere.
Michelle: [Holding champagne bottle between her thighs as she uncorks it.] And You can do that.
Talia: I have always wanted to do that.
Michelle: To Hillary Clinton!
Talia: Hear hear!
Michelle: Drink up. I want to take my new pantsuit out for a spin. See if guys can pick up on my new polyester super powers.

Talia: Ah, girls, you know what marrying a lovely man of means means? No more performing. I can hang up the tights, hang up the headdresses. Do you know I have worked every new year's Eve since I was 17? I have never celebrated new year's. Now Rick and I can celebrate new year's.
Michelle: If he makes it to new year's.
Sasha: So obvious.
Michelle: Getting sloppy.
Sasha: And I can craft. I've always wanted to craft.
Michelle: You have never wanted to craft.
Sasha: Well, I do now. It'll be dirty crafting, but it'll be crafting. And I don't have to go to the gym six days a week. I can even gain three pounds. Think about that!
Michelle: I'd still love you if you gained five.
Sasha: And I can get a pack of Pekingese to greet me at the door when I come home from not working or working out. And I can feed them from my giant bowl of bonbons.

Sasha: [thinking someone is in her apartment and checking with Roman] Listen, there's a baseball bat under the couch.
Roman: I don't need a baseball bat.
Sasha: And there's an umbrella in the linen closet. It's got pretty pony on it, but the end's really pointy. You can poke his eyes out.
Roman: [loudly] Hello?
Sasha: There's a tennis racket by the fireplace and there's ammonia under the sink.
Roman: So we can disinfect him?
Sasha: Blind him. Then we'll overtake him.
Roman: Unless he found the pretty pony umbrella, in which case we're done for. Was this door closed when you left?
Sasha: Yes. No. I don't remember.
Roman: [looks seriously at the door] Get the pretty pony.

Bash: Everybody, may I have your attention please? I really need a young boy. Or girl to volunteer for some heavy lifting. I include both sexes because in the past, my saying I need a young boy led to a lot of misunderstandings. So I'm including you ladies as well. You just need strong backs and toned thighs. If you fit the bill, please come see me. To be clear, I like men and women equally. Both sexes work for me.

Melanie: Fanny choreographed a whole ballet about Billy Elliot a couple years ago.
Michelle: Billy Elliot is already a show.
Ginny: Ours wasn't about Billy. It was about Billy's coal miner father.
Melanie: We all got black lung at the end.

Cozette: Let me tell you a story. Last year, my family went on this private safari: my parents, Frankie. It's sunset, and we're walking down this trail, golden skies, beautiful vistas, and we see this little baby antelope on the horizon.
Ginny: Yeah?
Cozette: We get closer, and it turns its head to look at us. And the guide says, "Turn away. A lion's had at it."
Ginny: I don't get it.
Cozette: It had been half eaten by a lion.
Ginny: Oh my God.
Cozette: It was horrible. Everybody froze, and I thought "it's wrong to turn my back" and let this poor little thing just sit there and bleed out, like Judi Dench in that James Bond movie. So I grabbed a gun and shot it in the head.
Ginny: You blew a baby antelope's head off?
Cozette: Put it right out of its misery. And you, my dear, are a half-eaten baby antelope.
Ginny: you're gonna shoot my head off?

Melanie: Not for like years.
Dez: What happened?
Melanie: She's into someone else.
Dez: Why? Charlie's cool.
Melanie: It wasn't so much why, it was the why nots. And she likes this other guy.
Dez: Huh. Kinda thought for a while there'd be a double-date thing or something.
Melanie: You mean you and me?
Dez: Yeah.
Melanie: No.
Dez: Why not?
Melanie: Because.
Dez: My mom says because is a word, not a reason.
Melanie: Well, that's the reason. Because, okay? Because.
Dez: So you can't think of a reason why?
Melanie: I don't know.
Dez: If you can't think of a reason why, can you think of a reason why not?
Melanie: Not offhand.
Dez: Then why not?

Boo: I don't need to buy condoms. I'm on the pill.
Ginny: What?
Melanie: Since when?
Boo: As soon as my mother heard about Carl, she marched me down to the doctor's and put me on the pill.
Sasha: You and Carl are having sex?
Boo: What? No.
Ginny: Then why are you on the pill?
Boo: I just told you.
Melanie: I'm gobsmacked.
Ginny: What does it taste like?
Boo: I don't know. I stick it in a Peppermint Patty.
Rajahnae: Hey, what's going on?
Sasha: is on the pill.
Rajahnae: You're having sex with Carl?
Boo: Why does everybody hear I'm on the pill and automatically think I'm having sex?
Sasha: You are absurd, Boo. You know that? Absurd.
Boo: Why?
Sasha: Because you're on the pill but not having sex. It's like having a superpower and not using it.

Fanny: [aftering finding Scotty asleep on her couch] You told him where I kept my key?! [now seeing Godot in Michelle's bed] Oh, you're kidding.
Michelle: Fanny, you're back.
Fanny: I'm gone two weeks, I come back and you're in bed with a child who wears flip-flops in public.
Godot: Hey, Fanny.
Fanny: Hello, Godot.
Michelle: I didn't know you were coming back today.
Fanny: How many men do you have stashed around here, huh?
Michelle: You were supposed to come back next week.
Godot: [seeing the photo on Michelle's phone she took of him while he was sleeping] Oh, is that me?
Fanny: There's a man in my living room, a man in your bed.
Michelle: I wrote it down. [getting out of bed in her underwear]
Fanny: Is there one in the garage? Three in the potting shed?
Michelle: [showing Fanny her phone] See? Next week. The 20th.
Fanny: Today is the 20th.
Michelle: [looking at her phone again] Crap, I missed my dentist appointment.
Fanny: Who was the man in my house?
Michelle: I don't know.
Fanny: You told him to stay there. You showed him my key.
Michelle: I did?
Scotty: [running in] I'm sorry. I thought she was out of town.
Michelle: Scotty?
Fanny: Who's Scotty?
Scotty: I'm Scotty.
Michelle: Scotty's my brother.
Godot: [still in bed] Excuse me.
Michelle: [to Scotty] I thought you left.
Scotty: I did leave, but I needed a place to stay for a few days, and I didn't want to bother you.
Fanny: So you broke into my house like Robert Downey Jr.?
Michelle: You can't just come in and out like this. [to Godot] You should get up.
Godot: I'm kind of-
Scotty: I know. I'm sorry.
Michelle: You have to call.
Scotty: I lost my phone.
Michelle: Who loses their phone?
Scotty: Lots of people lose their phones.
Godot: Can someone hand me a towel or a throw blanket?
Fanny: My house is not a hostel. It is where I live and sleep.
Michelle: I didn't know he was coming.
Godot': A dishcloth maybe?
Scotty: I think I left it in Monterey.
Michelle: Then go back and get it.
Scotty: Oh, I'm not going back to Monterey.
Michelle: Why? What's her name?
Fanny: Whose name?
Godot: A tea kettle?
Michelle: Whoever it is that chased him out of Monterey.
Godot: Baking sheet?
Scotty: You are jumping to conclusions again.
Godot: A skillet.
Fanny: [finally to Godot] How about some pants? Before the baking sheet and the skillet, how about we find you your pants?
Godot: Pants would work.
Fanny: Find his pants.
Michelle: [looking around] Pants, pants, pants.
Scotty: Maybe I don't like aquariums. Or Monterey Jack cheese. Maybe cheese and aquariums are why I won't go back to Monterey. Did you ever think of that?
'Fanny: I don't see any pants.
Michelle: [pointing to Godot] Last night, you sure you had pants?
Godot: Pretty sure.
Fanny: Retrace your steps. You started this whole thing where?
Michelle: Car. We started in the car.

Sasha: This is your relationship, Boo. Don't you care?
Boo: About what?
Sasha: About the things Carl's done.
Boo: No, not really.
Sasha: But what he's done affects you.
Boo: How?
Sasha: What if you're not experienced enough, huh? That can ruin some relationships.
Boo: I'm not experienced enough. It seems to be fine so far.
Ginny: Yeah, how experienced you are doesn't matter to a lot of guys.
Sasha: What if he's got a kid?
Boo: Carl doesn't have a kid. He doesn't even have a bike.

Sasha: Boo, I think we need to step it up.
Boo: Step what up?
Sasha: I think we need to consider having sex now.
Boo: With each other?
Sasha: No, with Roman and Carl. Me with Roman, you with Carl.
Boo: But Carl and I are waiting.
Sasha: A year and a half is a long time. Time that includes dances, parties. Friday night parties that he can go to and you can't because you have class in the morning. And there's girls at these parties.
Boo: Party girls.
Sasha: That time also includes camp. Six weeks where you're apart. And he'll be a junior counselor this year. He'll wear the gray shorts. He'll be doing bed checks. He'll have privileges, power. That's a big turn-on to a lot of girls.
Boo: I know.
Sasha: Plus, in a year and a half you're not the new girlfriend anymore. You're just the old girlfriend who made him wait a year and a half. You're planning on doing it with him anyhow, so what's the difference if you just move it up a bit?
Boo: You're ready? With Roman?
Sasha: I think timing is important. We should strike while the iron is hot.
Boo: But what do we do? How do we work this? I need to shave my legs.
Ginny': Hey. What are you guys doing?
Ginny: How long were we asleep?
