Will: Sharon, the NEA is a loser. Yeah, it accounts for a penny out of our paycheck, but he gets to hit you with it any time he wants. It doesn't cost money, it costs votes; it costs airtime, column inches. You know why people don't like liberals? Because they lose. If liberals are so fucking smart, how come they lose so goddamn always?
Sharon: Hey-!
Will: [without letting her finish, he directs his attention to Lewis] And with a straight face, you're gonna tell students that America's so star-spangled awesome, that we're the only ones in the world who have freedom? Canada has freedom, Japan has freedom, the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Australia, Belgium has freedom. [laughs] So 207 sovereign states in the world, like a hundred and eighty of them have freedom.
Moderator: Alright–
Will: And yeah, you, sorority girl. Just in case you accidentally wander into a voting booth one day, there's some things you should know, and one of them is, there's absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world. We're 7th in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, 3rd in median household income, number 4 in labor force, and number 4 in exports. We lead the world in only 3 categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next 26 countries combined. 25 of whom are allies. Now, none of this is the fault of a 20 year old college student. But you, nonetheless, are without a doubt a member of the worst. generation. ever. So when you ask, "what makes us the greatest country in the world?" I dunno know what the fuck you're talking about. Yosemite? [Pause] We sure used to be. We stood up for what was right. We fought for moral reasons. We passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors. We put our money where our mouths were. And we never beat our chest. We built great big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, and we cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars, acted like men. We aspired to intelligence, we didn't belittle it, it didn't make us feel inferior. We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in our last election. And we didn't... we didn't scare so easy. We were able to be all these things, and to do all these things, because we were informed. By great men, men who were revered. First step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. America is not the greatest country in the world anymore. [Pause] Enough?

But once in a while, take three seconds- you can't spare more than that- take three seconds to notice where you are and what you're doing.

Will: Good evening. From New York City, I'm Will McAvoy. ACN is now able to report and confirm that for the first time in almost three decades, the world has no reason to fear Osama bin Laden. In just a moment, in a live address to the nation, the president will announce that in a coordinated operation under the cover of darkness, US Special Forces tonight killed the leader of al-Qaeda and the mastermind behind the deadly attack of September 11th, 2001. It's been nine years, seven months, and 20 days since America's most wanted criminal took from us 2,977 American sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, friends and colleagues. We were transformed that morning into a different nation, more fearful and so, of course, more hostile. And while nothing, not even this victory our country has waited for for such a long time, can bring back the souls lost on that terrible morning in New York City, in Virginia, in a field in Pennsylvania, and all across America and the world, let tonight serve as a welcome reminder that throughout our history, America's darkest days have always been followed by its finest hours. Here now, from the East Room of the White House, the President of the United States. [goes into the presidents address]

Mac: I don't own a lot of stock...
Sloan: Let me tell you why.
Mac: [upset] I really can't deal with this right now—
Sloan: [raising her voice] Stop avoiding this! I just got off the phone with these guys. Listen to these quotes. These aren't from liberals. These are hardcore Wall Street guys who, whatever the world may think of them, know what they're talking about and so do I. Jamie Dimon at Chase says: "Voting against raising the debt ceiling would be a moral disaster." The Barclay's guys say "This debate is detached from reality." My Goldman source says: "If the House Republicans continue this debate, I hope they're willing to mark the end of the dollar as the Global Reserve Currency." Please notice that he didn't say: "If the House Republicans don't raise the debt ceiling." HE SAID: "If the House Republicans continue this debate." That's all it takes. Just the uncertainty. That's why the Dow is gonna close down 230 points today. Because just the debate. Just the doubt. Just the possibility that the House Majority might commit the greatest self-inflicted damage to [raising her voice] the country since the SECESSION OF THE SOUTH has caused billions in value to disappear."
Mac: Sloan, I understand. I swear to God I do. But you can't say the same thing in the C-block?
Sloan: Don't pretend that you don't know that most people watch 10 minutes of news. The first 10 minutes.
Mac: The vote isn't until tomorrow night and it's only the first vote and you said yourself it was cosmetic. Why do we have to feature it tonight?
Sloan: We should've been featuring it weeks ago. We should've been leading with it every night.
Mac: Why do we have to feature it tonight?
Sloan: To give time for the people to call their Congressman and say: "If you fuck with the full faith and credit of the US Treasury, you're fired!" To give time for the people to jam the phone lines of the District Offices, to give the people TIME to say: "I'm a fiscal conservative, and you've gotta put the pin back in the grenade right now."

Jim: Nope, my memory is fresh.
Maggie: Here's my question.
Jim: Good.
Maggie: What does God's voice sound like? [everyone laughs] I'm completely serious. She's saying that God spoke directly to her. How is this not the first question asked in a debate? How's it not the only question? What does His voice sound like? What did He say exactly word for word? Did He speak in Hebrew? Acadian? Kiswahili-Bantu? And to put it in a medical context, is this the first time you've heard voices? She's claiming to be a prophet. The whole world is sitting on the edge of their seat. How is this not the first question we'll ask?
Jim: First of all, can you stop pointing at me and saying "she" and "her"?
Maggie: You're the one who wanted to play a woman. But tell me why that question is out of line.
Jim: Because it's not the best way to demonstrate seriousness of intent and it's not the best way not to insult people.
Maggie: Which people?
Martin: Christians. 83 percent of the country.
Maggie: I'm one of them. And she's insulting me!
Jim: Please, stop pointing at me when you are–
Maggie: Relax, J. Edgar. She's insulting me, she's insulting my family, she's insulting my congregation, and she's insulting my faith. She's implying that Christians are imbeciles who will believe anything while reducing God to a party hack who endorses political candidates. Now, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is the first time since Moses that God has given direct instructions to someone other than His son. But if so, I think it deserves a follow-up.

Will: No, sir. Have you had to change doctors?

Will: My question was name three freedoms that you had the day before the president was sworn in that you don't have now. [to Maggie as Gingrich] Mr. Speaker, you just said that if you're elected, the price of gas will be $2.50 a gallon. How does the US President control the price of oil?

Name an instance in which the president has apologized for America and can you imagine no instance in which a US president should apologize for America?

Neal: It's not going to be okay with the restaurant.

Charlie: We had a story that the US used sarin gas on a village in Pakistan and we went. Anybody would have. Most people would have gone months earlier. To not go would have been to participate in the biggest cover-up since--These were war crimes. It was a Sunday special report. Neilson tracking showed it was gonna be a monster audience--Three and a half, four million. It ended up closer to six. By 10:05, I knew we had a problem. None of it was true.

Mac: Did you tell him we have the raw footage?
Charlie: Yea.
Mac: Raw footage isn't edited out of context. It isn't edited at all.
Charlie: I told him that.
Mac: What did he say?
Charlie: He said he was gonna kill me.
Will: Did he say it the way Mac says it to me or did it seem like he meant it?
Mac: I mean it when I say it to you.
Charlie: He was very upset.
Mac: Tell him I'm gonna go right now to look at the raw interview again and that he can look at it with me if he wants.
Charlie: All right.

Don: This is the very last polling data taken before the polls open tomorrow.
Rebecca Halliday: Who's gonna win?
Don: The president will be reelected. But Tulsi Gabbard's gonna win in Hawaii's second. She'll be the first Samoan in Congress. And Kerry Bentivolio is gonna take the seat vacated by Thaddeus McCotter, who came out with my pick for the best resignation statement of all time. "The recent event's totalities of calumnies, indignities and deceits have weighed most heavily upon my family. Thus, acutely aware one cannot rebuild their hearth among the ruins of their US House office, for the sake of my loved ones, I must strike another match, go start anew by embracing the promotion back from public servant to sovereign citizen." Sounds like he and his friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are about to take a journey by sea to ask the Duke of Verona for his most kind blessing.

Leona Lansing: Than one individual. That is beautiful. Not as beautiful as Daniel Craig.
Charlie: Leona.
Leona Lansing: I'd have sent my plane.

Charlie: Our trust numbers are--
Leona Lansing: Yeah, they're bad.

Will: Well, I wouldn't go that--

You don't make me a nickel and you cause headaches for the divisions that do, but you make me-- You make me so proud. God, guy comes in here, cooks an interview, and this ends up with-- 'Cause he's unemployable he gets a $5 million settlement and the three of you leave? Oh, I don't think so. And McMac. That's a name that's really starting to grow on me. She doesn't have to go. Nobody's ever heard of her. But she's going to do the honorable thing. And what's expected of me, huh? Not to do the honorable thing? What's expected of me? No, I do not accept your resignations! And Jerry Dantana's not gonna get one fucking dollar! I got some kick-ass courtroom outfits.
Will: You have to accept our resignations and you have to settle. He'll take it to trial and win. There was an institutional failure and he was the only one fired.
Rebecca Halliday: Then you'll need a good lawyer. Lee, don't accept their resignations.
Leona Lansing: I already wasn't accepting their resignations, Becca. Don't horn in on my honorable thing. God, I mean, can't a lady have--

Charlie: If a news outlet doesn't have credibility, it doesn't matter what else it has. That's a fact. There are people here from Jane Barrow, Terry Smith, everyone at the DC bureau to Sloan Sabbith, Elliot Hirsch, everyone on Dayside, these people don't deserve to have a piano strapped to their back. Their credibility shouldn't-- (to Rebecca) When did you arrive here?
Rebecca: I'm stealthy.
Charlie: I think it's commendable and pretty shocking that you want to do something just because it's the right thing to do, but it's not the right thing to do.
Reese: I know.
Charlie: What do you mean?
Reese: I think you were responsible for a massive fuckup. I think Will was the face of a massive fuckup. I think firing a mid-level producer appears to be an abdication of responsibility. Now we're gonna have to read about Jim and Maggie and Don and Jim and Maggie and Don and Maggie and Mac and Will and did Sloan punch a guy in the face?
Charlie: Yeah.
Reese: The train, she is wrecked.
Charlie: Why are you gleeful?
Rebecca: I'm on the right team for once and I get really paid.
Charlie: Are you saying you agree?
Reese: I think your resignation should be accepted immediately and we should write Dantana a check and get to the business of rebooting this once respected brand.
Charlie: Then why don't you?
Reese: [sheepishly] My mom says I can't.

Taylor: It's after midnight now and I feel like I can ask a question.
Sloan: Sure.
Taylor: I meant to Will.
Will: Yes.
Taylor: Who did you vote for today?
Will: You know I'm not answering that.
Taylor: I thought you might because you revealed your party affiliation on the air last year.
Will: I did. I identified myself as a Republican because I thought it was fair to give to the viewer given the commentary I was delivering.
Taylor: A commentary that ended with you calling the Tea Party the American Taliban.
Will: Yes.
Taylor: And in the body of the commentary - was a blistering indictment of Republicans.
Will: Exactly the opposite. It was a blistering indictment of people who aren't Republicans.
Taylor: Well, who's to say who is and who isn't?
Will: On that night, I did.
Taylor: I want to remind you you asked me to pursue this area.
Will: I understand.
Taylor: And I'm wondering, with all respect, do you call yourself a Republican so you can make a claim to credibility when you attack the GOP?
Will: No, I call myself a Republican 'cause I am one. I believe in market solutions and I believe in common sense realities and the necessity to defend ourselves against a dangerous world and that's about it. Problem is now I have to be homophobic. I have to count the number of times people go to church. I have to deny facts and think scientific research is a long con. I have to think poor people are getting a sweet ride. And I have to have such a stunning inferiority complex that I fear education and intellect in the 21st century. But most of all, the biggest new requirement, really the only requirement, is that I have to hate Democrats. And I have to hate Chris Christie for not spitting on the president when he got off Air Force One. The two-party system is crucial to the whole operation. There's honor in being the loyal opposition. And I'm a Republican for the same reasons you are. So I hope your voice gets louder in the next four years.
Taylor: Well, I don't like losing, so count on it.

Charlie: You ever read Jedediah Purdy, For Common Things?
Will: No.
Charlie: He talks about cynical times. People having terminal irony with a studied refusal to hope or care openly. Does that sound like us?
Will: No.
Charlie: No. Have you asked yourself tonight why we never reported the Petraeus story?
Will: The Petraeus?
Charlie: Remember? David Petraeus is resigning on Thursday.
Will: We didn't report it.
Charlie: That's funny.
Will: I forgot. Yeah.
Charlie: It's because we never made the trade. The decision was that the other story had information voters needed, the Petraeus story didn't. Not that many voters. It would have affected maybe a few thousand, tops. In one district, one seat. As opposed to breaking two days early what will be a giant story. Breaking it in front of an Election Night audience. And the decision to decline the trade was made instantly and unanimously. Don pushed back reflexively, but he came around in seven seconds. Don. We've come a long way. I'm not resigning. And neither are you. What, are we out of our fucking minds? Dantana doctored the tape. That's what happened, Will. We know the truth and the mob doesn't. When did we decide it was an institutional failure? We waited 11 months. We know people who would have gone after the second red team meeting or even the first. You agree with what I'm saying?
Will: I believe, except for the things we did wrong, we did everything right. And I can't live with Mac taking the blame for--
Charlie: We'll get the audience's trust back. Like Leona said, we're gonna overcome the terminal irony. And the laundry list of embarrassing things in the complaint? I've got to tell you, I'm not embarrassed. The Zimmerman tape, Jim going to New Hampshire, Sloan punching a guy in arbitrage-- I actually like that one. [pause, he notices Will is staring off into space] I can't tell what you're thinking. [pause] Will? It's gotten strange now. Are you able to hear me speaking? She--

Will: There's a story about a little kid who keeps shredding paper and his parents take him to all kinds of doctors to get him to stop shredding paper. And finally they take him to the most expensive doctor in the world who turns to the kid and he says, "Kid, if you stop shredding paper, your parents will stop dragging you to doctors." And the kid turns to his parents and says, "Why didn't you just say so?"
Mac: Well, all right, then.
Will: The point of the story is that the kid could make himself happy by just stopping. I think that's the point. I don't know. I've been trying to figure it out. But I didn't return it. Because I'm in love with you.
Mac: What did you say?
Will: And because of-- Will you marry me?
Mac: Wait.
Will: I said will you marry me? And before that, I said I'm in love with you. That's-- that's-- That's what I'm getting at. I feel like I can do this so much better if I can have a second.
Mac: What in the fuck is happening right now?
Will: If-- if I-- I don't ever want to not be-- No. I love you. I'm gonna go back to that. And will you marry me? And let me just say I really think you should. I think you should say yes. But no matter what you say, there's no chance I am ever gonna hurt you again. And no matter what you say, I'm gonna be in love with you for the rest of my life. There's no way out of that. That's just a physical law of the universe. You own me. No matter what you say--
Mac: Yes.
Will: I will never stop--
Mac: Yes.
Mac: I'm saying yes.
Will: You're saying yes?
Mac: Yes.
Will: Thank God.
