Walter: My name is Walter Hartwell White, I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico. 87104. To all law enforcement entitles, this is not an admission of guilt. I am speaking to my family now. Skyler, you are the love of my life. I hope you know that. Walter Junior, you're my big man. There are...there are going to be some things that you'll come to learn about me in the next few days. I just want you to know that no no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart. Good-bye.

Walter: I was curious. Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much, but methamphetamine? I didn't picture that. There's a lot of money in it, huh?
Jesse: I don't know what you're talking about.
Walter No?
Jesse: Not a clue.
Walter: "Cap'n Cook?" That's not you? Like I said, no one is looking for you.
Jesse: Look, I don't know what you think you're doing here, Mr. White. I mean, if you're planning on giving me some bullshit about getting right with Jesus by turning myself in...
Walter: Not really.
Jesse: High school was a long time ago. You ain't Welcome Back, Kotter, so step off. No speeches.
Walter: Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name – Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square 1. But you know the business. And I know the chemistry. I'm thinking...maybe you and I could partner up.
Jesse: You, uh...you want to cook crystal meth? You. You and, uh...and me?

Walter: The shit you cook is shit. I saw your set-up. Ridiculous. You and I will not make garbage. We will produce a chemically pure and stable product that performs as advertised. No adulterants. No baby formula. No chili powder.

Krazy-8: I guess I'd start off by promising that if you let me go, I won't come after you. That you'd be safe. I guess I'd say what happened between us never happened. And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it. But you know that anybody in my situation would make promises like that, and though in my case they happen to be true, you'd never know for sure. So what else can I tell you?

But what good is it, to just survive if I am too sick to work, to enjoy a meal, to make love? For what time I have left, I want to live in my own house. I want to sleep in my own bed.

Jesse: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. While you were cooking, you know, he was watching one of those, uh, those, uh, telenovels, y'know, with all those ripe honeys on it? Y'know, he was really into it. I told you not to change the channel, man! Y'know, dude needs his eye candy. That's it!

Walter: We tried to poison you. We tried to poison you because you are an insane, degenerate piece of filth and you deserve to die.

Jesse: [kicking Tuco into the shallow pit] Who's the bitch now?!

Walter: There was no fugue state. I remember everything. The truth is I couldn't stand to spend another second in that house. I just had to...get out. And so I left. I didn't think about it, I just did it. I walked for a long time, and when I couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked. I got as far as Gallup. And then it was just time to come home.
Therapist: So, being found naked in a supermarket, that was your way of giving credibility to a lie? Of avoiding questions about your disappearance? Why run away? What did you feel you had to run from?
Walter: Doctor, my wife is seven months pregnant with a baby we didn't intend. My fifteen-year old son has cerebral palsy. I am an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher. When I can work, I make $43,700 per year. I have watched all of my colleagues and friends surpass me in every way imaginable. And within eighteen months, I will be dead. And you ask why I ran?

Among gangsters,
The gringo's fame is inflated
'Cause of the new drug they created.
They say the color is blue
And the quality pure.
The potent drug's runnin'
Through the city,
And no one could stop it
If they wanted to.
The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect.
Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now.
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face.
The cartel's 'bout respect
And they ain't forgiving.
But that homie's dead,
He just doesn't know it yet.
Heisenberg's fame has got
Down to Michoacan.
From way far away
They want to taste that meth.
That blue stuff crossed the border,
Now New Mexico's livin' up to its name.
Looks like Mexico
In all the drugs it's hiding.
Except there's a gringo boss
And he's known as "Heisenberg".
The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect,
Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now.
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face.

Ain't no one escaped it yet.

He just doesn't know it yet.

Walter: So this is what? Blackmail?
Saul: Walter, I'm your lawyer. Anything you say to me is totally privileged. I'm not in the shakedown racket. I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers need lawyers, right? Especially drug dealers.
Walter: So what? You're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart?
Saul: C'mon. Have you seen my hourly rate? Heh-heh. Oh by the way, where do you keep the money? Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar buried in the side yard, huh? You know, this kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up, but he won't be the last. And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?
Walter: I don't understand. What exactly are you offering to do for me?
Saul: What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?
Walter: I'm no Vito Corleone.

Walter: Jesus, Skyler. Get me a Bible to swear on, if that's what it takes. I am not having an affair with Gretchen!
Skyler: Oh, I know. I know you're not. 'Cause I asked her. It really took me forever to get in touch with her. She was ducking my calls for weeks. So I finally left a message, "What exactly is going on between you and my husband?" I thought that'd get her attention and it did. So she called me back and she finally told me. The money? For your treatment? Gretchen and Elliott didn't give you a dime. They paid for nothing. You refused every offer they made you, but that didn't make sense because I checked with Delcavoli in the hospital and, not including your surgery, we're nearly paid up. Over $100,000. Out of where? Out of thin air? But then, I called your mother. Yeah. Thanks for that, too. But I thought, y'know, maybe she has some money that I don't know about? Maybe she contributed? It's possible. It turns out that not only is the money not your mother, she didn't even know that you have cancer. You never went to see her. I dropped you at the airport, I picked you up, you were gone for four days, and yet she swears that you were never there. Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

Saul: Let's not get lost in the who, whats and whens. The point is we did our due diligence and she didn't talk. She kept quiet, she stood by you, Walt. Which, if you ask me, is the ironical silver lining here. I mean, on the one hand, sure, she snuck off the reservation to get some dirty damp and deep. On the other–

[Hank is being investigated for beating up Jesse]
Hank Schrader: ...I was convinced that Mr. Pinkman was involved in the manufacture and distribution of phenyl-2 methamphetamine, specifically what we're calling the blue meth. I tracked him to a scrapyard where he stored an early-'80s camper, an RV. While waiting for a warrant to search this vehicle, which I believe to be a rolling meth lab, I received a telephone call telling me my wife Marie had been injured in an accident. Upon hearing the news, I left Mr. Pinkman and his vehicle to tend to my wife. After arriving at the hospital, I learned the emergency call was a hoax. My wife, fortunately, was unharmed. [clears throat] So I immediately went back to the salvage yard, but the RV was gone, most likely destroyed on site.
Detective #1: And it was at this point you drove to the home of Jesse Pinkman? [Hank's lawyer whispers something to him]
Hank's Lawyer: I think we're done here. Agent Schrader needs to get home to get some rest.
Detective #1: That's fine. But just to confirm, you're taking the Fifth here?
Hank Schrader: Yeah, that's correct.
Detective #2: Okay. Well, we just wanna give you all a heads up. Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges in this matter. He's given a detailed version of events as he sees them.
Hank's Lawyer: The word of a methhead.
Detective #1: We know all about his history. We're well aware, but toxicology on Pinkman...his blood is clean, he's not using.
Detective #2: The kid is even refusing his doctor-ordered pain meds, as far as we can tell.
Hank Schrader: So, um, where do we go from here?
George Merkert: A couple of gentlemen from OPR will come down, probably tomorrow morning. Janice will give us an exact time on that. [To the AQPD detectives] And you men will be continuing your investigation, so, thanks for your time. [They all stand up]
Detective #1: Right. We just need one more thing: A photo of Agent Schrader's hands. For the record.
Hank Schrader: Yes, of course. [He looks at his right wrist]
Detective #1: Bandage off, if you would. [Hanks takes off the bandage]
Detective #2: On the table is fine. Flat on the table. That's fine. [Hank puts his right hand on the table and the detective takes a picture of the bruises on the right hand]

[The Cousins pull up to a semi truck parked in a deserted parking lot to meet with an arms dealer]
Arms Dealer: So, you the gentlemen? [The Cousins say nothing. The arms dealer opens the back doors to the trailer] Lucky you boys caught me. I've got a load to pick up, I'm taking the 40 straight through to Memphis! I can hammer it out in about 15, but there's this girl down here named Laney or Lolly or somethin'. Maybe Fran. Anyhow, she's got one of these fetish things, she likes to get peed on, y'know, so I was hoping to see her tonight, but she's real strict 'bout wanting to get to sleep before 10, so I wanna wrap it up here ASAP because traffic can be a wild card, y'know, rubberneckin' and such. [He starts taking off the tarps covering the crates containing his weapons] Surprising thing is the women who like to get peed on always tend to be from the warmer climates. You'd think the ones in the colder zones would be more inclined but I haven't met one yet. I mean, it's a shock to the system if the body is not properly acclimated, but y'know...leave that for smarter minds than me. Science is a mystery. [He looks up at the Cousins] Well, take a gander. Prices are negotiable. Buying in bulk gets you a discount. I'm running a special on these honeys. [The dealer walks over to a crate that contains a bunch of bullets, one of which he picks up] JHPs. Hollow-point bullets, known by the natives as "Black Death". Check it out. [He tosses it to Marco] You like that? It's so sweet, you'll wanna lick it! Nickel-plated brass casing, Lubalox coat for panache. Sucker has six razor claws that expand upon impact! PEW! [It'll] Shred your mama's head like a cabbage. [Marco considers then starts to hand it back to the dealer] Keep it. On the house. [Marco puts the Black Death bullet in his pocket] Anyhow, I've been windjamming long enough. Why don't you boys tell me what you're looking for. What it is you want, what is it you need? What can I do you for?
Leonel Salamanca: Vests.
Arms Dealer: Vests? Hell yeah, we've got vests! Right here. [He grabs two bulletproof vests from a satchel] Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded, non-interwoven Kevlar fiber. Stop a bullet like a soft wang against a Quaker girl! It just ain't getting through. And lightweight? Damn, so lightweight, you'll forget you're wearing it! [He tosses the vests, which hit the floor in front of the Cousins]
Marco Salamanca: Do they work?
Arms Dealer: Sure as shit, they do! [He unbuttons the top button on his shirt to reveal that he's wearing an identical bulletproof vest] I don't leave home without it!
[Leonel promptly pulls out his pistol and shoots the arms dealer in the exposed section of the vest. The arms dealer is knocked to the ground by the impact of the bullet]
Arms Dealer: Ugh! Ow! What the hell?! You....broke my freaking rib, you maniac son of a bitch!
[As the arms dealer groans in pain, Marco steps forward and looks at the spot where Leonel's bullet hit the vest. He pulls out the bullet and shows it to Leonel, who nods in approval. Marco reaches into his pocket and counts out a stack of $100 bills, which he drops in the dealer's lap. Leonel and Marco then slowly walk out of the truck]
Arms Dealer: You're welcome!

Walter: My brother-in-law, moments before he was attacked, someone called to warn him. I believe that same person was protecting me. Those two men – the assassins – I believe I was their prime target, but that somehow they were steered away from me to my brother-in-law. Because of this intervention, I am alive, and yet, I think that this person was playing a much deeper game. He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout, not a silent assassination. In one stroke, he bloodied both sides, set the American and Mexican governments against the cartel, and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the Southwest. If this man had his own source of product on this side of the border, he would have the market to himself. The rewards would be enormous. We're both adults. I can't pretend I don't know that person is you. I want there to be no confusion. I know I owe you my life, and more than that, I respect the strategy. In your position, I would have done the same.

Walter: I told him that I had a daughter and he told me he had one, too. And he said, "Never give up on family." And I didn't. I took his advice. My God, the universe is random; it's not inevitable, it's simple chaos. It's subatomic particles and endless pings, collision – that's what science teaches us. What does this say? What is it telling us that the very night that this man's daughter dies, it's me who is having a drink with him? I mean, how could that be random?
[Walter stumbles, starting to succumb to the sleeping pills]
Jesse: Hey, sit down.
Walter: No, no, it's, uh... Oh, that was the moment. That night. I should never have left home. Never gone to your house. Maybe things would have... Oh, I was...I was at home watching TV. Some nature program about elephants...and Skyler and Holly were in another room. I can hear them on the baby monitor. She was singing a lullaby. Oh, if I had just lived right up to that moment...and not one second more. That would have been perfect.

Saul: Yeah, there's guns and glow lights, and the kids wear the vests and they're split into teams...
Skyler: No, I actually know what it is, it's just that in relation to Walt, it doesn't make sense.
Saul: Makes more sense than you two being together. I'm still trying to figure out how that happened.

Walter: Why didn't you go after these guys two or three months ago?
Jesse: 'Cause I just found out about them.
Walter: What's to find out? It's a dispute over turf, right? I mean, how hard could it have been for you to track them down on their turf and kill them months ago? Because back then you were too busy getting high, feeling sorry. Murder is not part of your twelve-step program. This is not some amends that you have to make. What you are talking about here is pointless. This achieves nothing. It accomplishes nothing.
Jesse: If you don't see what it accomplishes, there is no way I can explain it you.

Walter: What can I do for you?
Mike: Have a seat, Walter. I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman and this plan of yours.
Walter: And?
Mike: I'm not gonna do it.
Walter: Why?
Mike: Because it's moronic.
Walter: Saul said you've done things like this before.
Mike: That's not the moronic part.
Walter: OK, so what's the problem?
Mike: The problem is the boss wouldn't like it.
Walter: Saul?
Mike: My boss. Your boss. This is a professional courtesy. No one knows I'm here, understand? But our employer would find out like always, and if Pinkman were arrested, he'd take it as a problem. Walt, you got a good thing going here. We all do. You want to risk it all on one junkie? Now I realize you two have a history, but this kid's been on the bubble a while now. It's a long time coming.
Walter: What is?
Mike: [Chuckles] Um... I used to be a beat cop, long time ago. And I'd get called out on domestic disputes all the time, hundreds probably over the years. But there was this one guy, this one piece of shit, that I will never forget: Gordy. He looked like Bo Svenson. You remember him? Walking Tall? You don't remember?
Walter: No.
Mike: Anyway. Big boy; 270, 280. But his wife, or whatever she was, his lady, was real small. Like a bird, wrists like little branches. Anyway, my partner and I get called out there every weekend and one of us would pull her aside and say, "C'mon, tonight's the night we press charges." And this wasn't one of those 'deep down he really loves me' setups, we got a lot of those, but not this. This girl was scared. She wasn't gonna cross him no way, no how. Nothing we could do but pass her off to the EMTs, put him in the car, drive him downtown, throw him in the drunk tank. He sleeps it off, next morning out he goes, back home. But one night, my partner's out sick and it's just me. And the call comes in and it's the usual crap. Broke her nose in the shower kind of thing. So I cuff him, put him in the car and away we go. Only that night, we're driving into town, and this sideways asshole is in my backseat humming 'Danny Boy'. And it just rubbed me wrong. So instead of left, I go right, out into nowhere. And I kneel him down and I put my revolver in his mouth and I told him, "This is it. This is how it ends." And he's crying, going to the bathroom all over himself, swearing to God he's gonna leave her alone, screaming – much as you can with a gun in your mouth. And I told him to be quiet, that I needed to think about what I was gonna do here. And of course he got quiet. Goes still, and real quiet, like a dog waiting for dinner scraps. And we just stood there for a while: me acting like I'm thinking things over, and Prince Charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants. After a few minutes I took the gun out of his mouth and I say; "So help me if you ever touch her again I will such and such and such and such and blah blah blah blah blah".
Walter: Just... just a warning?
Mike: Hmph. Of course. Just trying to do the right thing. But two weeks later he killed her. Of course. Caved her head in with the base of a Waring blender. We got there, there was so much blood you could taste the metal. The moral of the story is, I chose a half measure when I should have gone all the way. I'll never make that mistake again. [stands up] No more half measures, Walter.

Gus: Sit down. I understand that you have a problem with two of my employees. It is true that they killed one of your associates. It is possible they acted rashly, but on the other hand there was a provocation. The man was selling on their territory. There is blame on both sides. This will go no further. It will be settled right here, right now.
Jesse: [to Walter] You told him?
Gus: [to the two dealers] Wait outside. [the two dealers leave and Gus turns to Jesse] Listen to me. You have one friend in this room. [points to Walter] This man. Those men outside are my trusted employees, and when I learned what you intended to do... If it wasn't for this man and the respect I have for him, I would be dealing with this in a very different way. Don't look at him, you look at me. This is what happens now: My men will come back inside and you will shake their hands and you will make peace and that will be the end of this.
Jesse No.
Walter: Jesse... [Gus motions for Walter to be quiet]
Gus: Pardon me?
Jesse: They use kids. These assholes of yours, they got an 11-year old kid doing their killing for them. You're supposed to be some kind of reasonable business man, this is how you do business? [to Walter] You okay with this? You got anything to say here?!
Gus: Bring them back. [the two dealers come back inside] No more children. You understand? [to Jesse] And you, you keep the peace. [Jesse nods] Say it.

Walter White: I'm quite well, thank you.
Gus Fring: No. Clearly you are not. No rational person would do as you have done. Explain yourself.
Walter White: My partner was about to get himself shot. I intervened.
Gus Fring: Some worthless junkie. For him, you intervened and put us all at risk? Some contemptible junkie who couldn't keep the peace for eight hours?
Walter White: That's right, he couldn't. He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an 11-year old boy.
Gus Fring: I heard about it. He should have let me take care of it.
Walter White: Maybe. Then again maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.
Gus Fring: [acting offended] Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child?
Walter White: I would never ask you that.
Gus Fring: Where is Pinkman now?
Walter White: I wouldn't know. Couple of time zones away at least. Beyond that I'd only be guessing. He has enough money to last forever. He knows he has to keep moving. You'll never find him.
Mike Ehrmantraut: I don't know, Walt. It's what I do after all.
Walter White: He's out of the picture. I saved his life, I owed him that, but now he and I are done, which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it? You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man, so if I may, I would like to review options with you, of which, it seems to me, you have two. Option A: you kill me right here and now. Apparently I have made that very easy for you. You can kill me, no witnesses, and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him, too. A pointless exercise, it seems to me, but that is option A.
Gus Fring: What is option B?
Walter White: I continue cooking. You and I both forget about Pinkman. We forget this ever happened. We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement. I prefer option B.
Gus Fring: You’d need a new assistant. [Walt nods]
Walter White: I could get right on that.
Gus Fring: No. This time, I choose.

Saul Goodman: Yeah! Attorney-client privilege. I mean, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you. I give up Pinkman, well, then you're gonna be asking, "Ol' Saul gives 'em up pretty easy. What's to keep him from giving me up?" Y'see, so, then where's the trust?

Jesse: So he's their boy, huh?
Walter: He's their boy.
Jesse: How long you think you got?
Walter: Well, he asks a lot of questions about the cooking process. I try to be as vague as possible but I got that guy Victor watching me, listening to every word I say. Maybe the only thing saving me is Gale's fastidiousness. Once he feels confident that he knows my entire method...
Jesse: So what do we do?
Walter: You know what we do.
Jesse: There's got to be some other way. Maybe it's better for you to just go the cops, alright? I mean, I can't believe I'm saying that and all, but for your family. Hey, the DEA would love you, the shit you tell them. Federal Witness Protection, that's a good deal. As for me, I'll hit the road, yo. I'll make it. We had a good run...but it's over.
Walter: Never the DEA. The cooking can't stop. That's the one thing I'm certain of – production cannot stop. Gus can't afford to. So if I'm the only chemist that he's got, then I got leverage and leverage keeps me alive, and it keeps you alive, too. I think I can see to that. If I'm the only chemist that he's got...
Jesse: I can't do it, Mr. White. Like you said, I'm not a...I can't do it.
Walter: I'll do it. I'm gonna need your help. I mean, they're watching me day and night. They never leave me alone with Gale, not for a moment. Hell, I don't even know where the man lives. He's not in the phonebook, I can't find him on the Internet, I can't do it in the lab – Victor's always there. I mean, if I can just shake Victor, even an hour one night, I think then that...I may be able to...make it look like an accident.

Saul: Ho ho ho ho! This one, she's a keeper. Well, I know an audit can be highly motivating. I know a gal over at Tax & Revenue, you give her ten minutes in this Bogdan fella's books, she'll have his sky raining frogs.
Skyler: No, we don't want to draw any unwanted tax attention. We don't want them looking at us after Bogdan sells.
Saul: Alright, how about an ICE raid? You know he's got illegals working over there. I mean, he just has to.

Gus: I handle the business operations.
Max: Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.
Eladio: Ah, a businessman! Good, good. But, tell me something. That chicken, so fabulous, so excellent... Besides that, what else do you have on your menu?
Max: We have several side dishes. Rice. Beans. Sometimes we prepare a carnitas entree if we come across fresh beef in the market.
Eladio: Anything else? Come on, be honest. There is nothing else you offer? A little taste of something else? Something on the side? Because when I send my men to your restaurant, they come back with more than just chicken. They come back with drugs. They come back high. No? You are selling them narcotics. Methamphetamine. No?
Gus: With all due respect, Don Eladio, I didn't sell it to them. I gave them samples.
Eladio: Samples.
Hector: Some businessman.
Gus: I gave them samples to give to you. To introduce you to our product.
Max: Don Eladio, Gustavo meant no offense. But he...that is to say we...could think of no other way to get your attention. We want to work with you, Don Eladio.
Eladio: I know all about methamphetamine. That's poor man's cocaine. Only bikers and hillbillies use it. There's no money in it.
Max: May I, Don Eladio...I am a biochemist by training. The methamphetamine we make is much superior to the so-called biker crank you know of. It is crystallized, like glass. Purer. And the chirality of the molecule – its very structure – is different. The narcotic effect is far more potent.
Gus: Don Eladio, this product is the drug of the future.
Eladio: Ah.
Gus: It'll triple your profits. Perhaps quadruple.
Juan: They're not only good cooks, they're great at shoveling manure.
Eladio: [laughing] No, no, no, continue, continue.
Gus: Right now, you deal almost exclusively in cocaine. But the coca plant can't grow in Mexico. You are no more than middlemen for the Colombians. They cut you a percentage for smuggling across the border. But the lion's share of the profit goes to them, despite your assumption of all the risk.
Max: This new crystal methamphetamine, it's stronger, more addictive than cocaine, which means it will move in higher volume. But most importantly, it's completely artificial. We can show you how to manufacture it, right here in Mexico.
Gus: And you keep all the profits.
Eladio: My men do like your product.
Juan: Si.
Eladio: Hector, what is wrong with you? Why did you not get glasses for our guests? Go on. [Hector goes to the bar] Good. You are quite the talent. I bet you learned cooking from your mama. Isn't that true? No? But...what about the chemistry?
Max: I studied at the University of Santiago. Gustavo paid for my education.
Eladio: Oh, really?
Max: I have degrees in both biochemistry and chemical engineering. With minimal capital investment, we can set up a factory-grade laboratory for you. Train your own people to manufacture large quantities of highly pure methamphetamine.
Eladio: Fantastic! Tell me one thing, though. If you're the cook...why do I need him?
Max: Senor?
Eladio: You. Businessman. Why should I negotiate with someone who doesn't respect me? Who insults me by dealing under my nose without my permission? Who manipulates me into a meeting in front of my own men? What do I need you for?
Gus: Don Eladio. Please. I didn't sell anything. I apologize if you are offended by my method of obtaining this meeting. I merely took the initiative. I meant no insult.
Max: Don Eladio, Gustavo didn't mean to offend. I know Gustavo like a brother. He's an honorable man. The most loyal man I have ever known. He rescued me from the Santiago slums. He made me the man I am today! Gustavo is a genius. He will make you millions! Just find it in your heart to forgive him this one small mistake. Please...He's my partner. I need him! I swear to God!
[Hector shoots Max in the head. Gus lunges at Hector, but Juan holds him back and pins him to the ground next to Max's dead body]
Hector: Look at him. You did this to him. Now, look at him.

Walter: I wish I could take back last night. It was your birthday; this shouldn't be on your mind.
Walter Jr.: It's OK.
Walter: No, it's not OK. I'm your father. I don't want last night to be... I mean, you really... you can't think of me like...
Walter Jr.: Like what? I don't understand.
Walter: My father died when I was six. You knew that, right?
Walter Jr.: Yeah.
Walter: He had Huntington's disease. It destroys portions of the brain, affects muscle control, and leads to dementia. It's just a nasty disease. It's genetic. Terrified my mother that I might have it, so they ran tests on me when I was a kid, but I came up clean. My father fell very ill when I was four, five. Spent a lot of time in the hospital. My, heh, my mother would tell me so many stories about my father. I mean, she would talk about him all the time. I knew about his personality, how he treated people, I even knew how he liked his steaks cooked: medium rare, just like you. I knew things about my father, I had a lot of information. It was because people would tell me these things. They would paint this picture of my father for me and I always pretended that was who I saw too, that I remembered. But it was all a lie. In truth, I only have one real, actual memory of my father. It must have been right before he died. My mother would take me to the hospital to visit him. And I remember the smell in there. The chemicals. It was as if they used every single cleaning product they could find in a 50 mile radius, like they didn't want you smelling the sick people. There was this stench of Lysol and bleach, you could just feel it coating your lungs. Anyway, there, lying on the bed, is my father. And he's all... he's all twisted up. My mom, she puts me on her lap, she's sitting on the bed next to him so I can get a good look at him, but really he just scares me. And he's looking right at me, but I can't even be sure he knows who I am. And your grandmother is talking, trying to be cheerful as she does, but the only thing I could remember is him breathing. There was this... this rattling sound, like if you were shaking an empty spray paint can. Like there was nothing in him. Anyway, that is the only real memory that I have of my father. I don't want you to think of me the way I was last night. I don't want that to be the memory you have of me when I'm gone.
Walter Jr. Remembering you that way wouldn't be so bad. The bad way to remember you would be the way you've been this whole last year. At least last night you were... you were real, y'know?

Hank Schrader: Oh, well, I don't suppose we could talk about the $2 million in your granddaughter's name?

Hank Schrader: Yeah. It seems that, uh, Fring had all these secret offshore accounts that he would deposit money into. Like, uh, well, an even dozen of them. And they're all in the names of certain people on his payroll. There was the, uh, the manager of the laundry, umm, a couple guys from the Pollos distribution center. Uh, there was the owner of a chemical warehouse, a bunch of others, you know. Guys that must've been getting paid off the books. Anyway, one of the names...was Kaylee Ehrmantraut. Ten years old and just cute as a button. Yeah. $2 million and change we found on deposit for her. Way more than anybody else. Now, my partner here? He took one look at that and said, "Shit, man! This fifth-grade girl is the muscle behind Fring's entire operation!" I said, "Whoa, whoa, hey, partner, slow down there. Maybe it was actually her dear old granddaddy." Impressive, no? That...[clicks his tongue] level of insight? [Mike stares at Hank and Gomez as he absorbs the realization that his funds have been seized] He's not impressed, Gomie.
Steven Gomez: Perhaps he's picturing all that money going "bye-bye".
Hank Schrader: Yeah, well, I mean, the government's gonna take every last dollar, unless... Well here's the thing, Mike-- Or Michael?
Mike Ehrmantraut: Mr. Ehrmantraut.
Hank Schrader: Here's the thing, Mike: Lucky for you, you didn't touch that money. I cannot say the same for the other eleven on the list.

Walter: What blood? Beneke?
Skyler: He's in the hospital because of me...
Walter: No.
Skyler: ...because of what I did.
Walter: Skyler, you can't beat yourself up over this thing. Please. You didn't set out to hurt anybody. You made a mistake and things got out of control. But you did what you had to do to protect your family. And I'm sorry, but that doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you a human being.
Skyler: Stop it, Walt. Just stop. I don't need to hear any of your bullshit rationales. I'm in it now. I'm compromised. But I won't — I will not — have my children living in a house where dealing drugs and hurting people and killing people is shrugged off as "shit happens!" We're back at it? Fine. But the kids stay away, and that's that.
Walter: "That's that?" That's what?
Skyler: I got them out of this house.
Walter: To a sleepover at their aunt and uncle's? They spend a day or two, Junior stays up late watching movies, and then what happens?
Skyler: We'll see.
Walter: No, I'll tell you what happens. They come home, to this house, to their parents who love them—
Skyler: No. I will not let our business endanger them.
Walter: How many times do I have to say that they are not in—
Skyler: I said no. I swear to God, I won't have them back here.
[Pause.]
Walter: What are you going to do to stop it?
Skyler: Whatever it takes. Everything in my power.
Walter: Like what? I mean specifically. What is your next move?
Skyler: My next move is, maybe I hurt myself. Make it clear we need more time. Let Hank and Marie see we're still struggling.
Walter: No, more like you're still struggling. So maybe next time, I have you committed, put you in some inpatient facility while I take care of the kids myself. Is that what you want?
Skyler: So then maybe I show up with bruises on my neck. Give myself a black eye. Say that you beat me when you found out about my lover.
Walter: I see. So you involve Ted. Ah, well, that'll be fun, bringing the police up to speed on all of that. But not as much as telling your sixteen-year-old son that his father is a wife-beater. Also not a very good plan. What else you got?
Skyler: I could send Junior away to school.
Walter: Oh. Now here's the conversation: "So honey, I know you've only got one year left in high school, but I would love it so much if you would drop everything, leave all your friends behind, and go to boarding school in Arizona." Do you have any other ideas? Because I'm not hearing a solution to your problem. How are you going to save our kids from this "terrible" environment?
Skyler: I...
Walter: What are you going to do? What, are you going to run off to France? Are you going to close the curtains, change the locks? This is a joke. Come on, Skyler! You want to take me on? You want to take away my children? What’s the plan?
Skyler: I don’t know! This is the best I could come up with, okay? I—I will count every minute that the kids are away from here—away from you—as a victory. But you're right. It's a bad plan. I don't have any of your magic, Walt. I don't know what to do. I'm a coward. I—I can't go to the police, I can't stop laundering your money, I can't keep you out of this house, I can’t even keep you out of my bed. All I can do is wait. That's it, that's the only good option. Hold on. Bide my time. And wait.

Skyler: For the cancer to come back.

Walter: You know, if this goes right, you could say we'll be pulling off the biggest train robbery in history.
Jesse: What about Jesse James?
Walter: Please. His biggest train robbery was in 1873, three thousand dollars. Adjusted for inflation, that's just fifty-seven grand.
[Jesse looks at Todd disbelievingly.]
Walter: All right. I couldn't sleep last night, so I looked it up. Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch, 1899; Union Pacific heist; Wilcox, Wyoming; an even fifty grand – today, $1.3 million. That's not bad. 1924, the Newton Gang – $38 million. 1963, the Great Train Robbery; Buckinghamshire, England; two-point-three million pounds sterling – or $48 million. That was the biggest one I could find. We are stealing a thousand gallons of methylamine. One gallon of forty-percent aqueous methylamine solution will yield seven-point-four pounds of product. Times a thousand gallons, at forty thousand dollars per pound, comes to $296 million. In terms of potential equivalency, more than all the others combined.

And then, well, something happened between the three of us. I'm not going to go into detail, but for personal reasons I decided to leave the company. And I sold my share to my two partners. I took a buyout for $5,000. Now at the time, it was a lot of money for me. Care to guess what that company is worth now?
Jesse: Millions?
Walter: Billions. With a 'B.' 2.16 billion as of last Friday. I look it up every week. And I sold my share, my potential, for $5,000. I sold my kids' birthright for a few months' rent.

Declan: Looks like you’re about a thousand gallons light here, Mike. Where’s the juice?
Walter: The methylamine isn’t coming.
Declan: Why is that? Who the hell are you?
Walter: I’m the man who’s keeping it.
Declan: [to Mike] What the hell’s this? We had an agreement, right? We got our deal. So where’s the tank, Mike?
Walter: Mike doesn’t know where it is; only I do. And you’re dealing with me now, not him.
Declan: Why don’t you just cut to what it is you want or what you think is going to happen here, alright? Because we’re going to get what we came for.
Walter: That thousand gallons of methylamine is worth more in my hands than it is in yours – or anyone else's even, for that matter. But I need distribution.
Declan: Distribution?
Walter: That’s right. So if you agree to give up your cook and sell my product instead, I’ll give you 35% of the take.
Declan: 35%. Wow, are you kidding me? Thirty-five? Mike, please tell me this is a joke. Do you know how far out we had to stick our necks out to get our hands on this cash? [To Walt.] And why the hell would we want you? You realize we have our own operation, right?
Walter: I know all about your operation. See, my partners here tell me that you produce a meth that’s 70% pure, if you’re lucky. What I produce, is 99.1% pure.
Declan: So?
Walter: So, it's grade-school T-ball versus the New York Yankees. Yours is just some tepid, off-brand, generic cola. What I'm making is Classic Coke.
Declan: Alright. Okay, so, um, if we just waste you – right here, right now, leave you in the desert – then there is no more Coke on the market, right? See how that works? There's only us.
Walter: Do you really want to live in a world without Coca-Cola?
[Declan laughs.]
[Walter throws a bag of blue meth at Declan’s feet.]
Walter: My partner tells me that your crew switched to a P2P cook because of our success. You dye your meth with food coloring to make it look like mine. You already ape my product at every turn. But now, you have the opportunity to sell it yourself.
Declan: I need you to listen to me. We’re not going to give up this deal to be your errand boys, do you understand? For what? To watch a bunch of junkies get a better high?
Walter: A better high means customers pay more. A higher purity means a greater yield. That’s $130 million of profit that isn’t being pissed away by some sub-standard cook. Now you listen to me. You’ve got the greatest meth cook in Am – no, the two greatest meth cooks in America – right here. And with our skills, you’ll earn more from that 35% than you ever would on your own.
Declan: Yeah, so you say. Just wondering why we’re so lucky. Why cut us in?
Walter: Mike is retiring from our crew. So his share of the partnership is available, if you can handle his end: distribution. And if you give him $5 million of the $15 million that you brought today. Just think of it as a finder’s fee for bringing us together. We have 40 pounds of product ready to ship. Ready to go. Are you ready?
Declan: [Laughs.] Who the hell are you?
Walter: You know. You all know exactly who I am. Say my name.
Declan: Do what? I don't–I don't have a damn clue who the hell you are.
Walter: Yeah you do. I'm the cook. I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.

Walter: How can you say that to me? Jesus! I mean, I'm the one who's a father! What, am I gonna curl up in a ball in tears in front of you, or am I gonna lock myself in a room and get high to prove it to you? What happened to that boy was a tragedy and it tears me up inside. But because it happened, am I supposed to just lie down and die with him? It's done! It makes me sick that it happened, just like everyone else who has died in our wake. What Todd did... you and I have done things that are just as bad.

Walter: Have you… Did you get to see a doctor? I mean, when one of these things last more than three days, you really should get that checked.
Hank: Yeah, no, I… I did and I’m fine. I’m, uh… I’m what they say on the upswing, you know?
Walter: Um. Good, good to hear.
Hank: Yeah.
Walter: When I heard you weren’t going in to work, I… Well, looks like you have the work coming to you. Perks of being the boss, huh?
Hank: Yeah, you know. How’s, uh… How’s things at the car wash?
Walter: Good. Yeah, really good. Hey, did you have any of that potato salad?
Hank: I don’t know. Maybe. Yeah, I mean.
Walter: No one else got sick, so you probably shouldn’t worry about it. Well, Skyler will be very happy to hear that you’re felling better. Which reminds me, I better get back to it. If there’s anything I can do…
[Hank nods.]
Walter: Feel better.
[Walter pats Hank’s back. Then Walter slowly walks out of the garage, stops and turns around.]
Walter: You know. You're going to laugh, but I have to ask you... about this.
[Walter holds up the GPS tracker to Hank's face.]
Walter: Believe it or not, I found this on my car. I mean, it looks just like the GPS tracker that we used on Gus Fring, doesn't it? Back when we were tracking him, just the two of us. You wouldn't know anything about this, would you, Hank?
[Hank closes the garage door.]
Walter: You okay? I gotta say, I don't like the way you're looking at me right now.
[After a beat, Hank punches Walt in the face and knocks him over a pile of boxes. He slams Walt against the garage door.]
Walter: Hank.
Hank: It was you. All along, it was you! You son of a bitch. You drove me into traffic to keep me from that laundry...
Walter: Calm down.
Hank: That call I got telling me Marie was in the hospital? That wasn't Pinkman. You had my cell number. You killed ten witnesses to save your sorry ass.
Walter: Listen to me.
Hank: You bombed a nursing home. Heisenberg. Heisenberg! You lying, two-faced sack of shit!
Walter: Hank, look... I don't–I don't know where this is coming from Hank, but–
Hank: I swear to Christ, I will put you under the jail.
Walter: Let's take a breath, okay? Just listen to yourself. These wild accusations, they could destroy our family! And for what?
Hank: Don't you give me shit about family!
[Beat.]
Walter: Hank, my cancer is back.
Hank: Good. Rot, you son of a bitch.
Walter: I'm sorry you feel that way. I wanna beat this thing. I do. I’m back on chemo, and I am fighting like hell. But the truth is in six months you won’t have someone to prosecute. But even– even if somehow you were able to convince anyone I was capable of doing these things, you and I both know I would never see the inside of a jail cell. I’m a dying man who runs a car wash. My right hand to God, that is all that I am. What’s the point?
Hank: Have Skyler bring the kids here, and then we’ll talk.
Walter: That is not going to happen.
Hank: I don't know who you are. I don't even know who I'm talking to.
Walter: If that's true – if you don't know who I am – then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.

Hank: Skyler, my– my head is spinning. And yours... I–I can't even imagine. So much makes sense to me now. You jumping in the pool. You sending us your kids, I get it. I just wished I'd seen it sooner. He's a monster. He's a– Look, I don't know what he did to you to force you to keep his secrets. If he threatened you, or whatever mind games he played. I don't know if there was abuse. But I want you to know that you can be open with me. Don't hold anything back, okay? I mean, I don't even understand if you know the full extent of this, what he's done. Not just the meth cooking, but the lives he's destroyed. But look, that's all behind you. Starting now, you're done being his victim. Because here's what we're gonna do. Sky, here's what we're gonna do: you and the kids are gonna move back to our house where you'll be safe, where he can't get to you.
Skyler: Hank, does Marie...
Hank: No, no, we'll get to that soon enough. It's just you and me right now, okay?
Skyler: Okay.
Hank: Before we, um, before we get you back to the house, I...
[Hank takes out a recording device and turns it on.]
Hank: I'm gonna ask you to tell me everything you can. Um, take as long as you like. Just, um, start from the beginning when you first became aware of Walt's activities, and just– just try to be as detailed as you can.
Skyler: Um, what? Right–right here? Right now?
Hank: Sure, why not? While it's still fresh, you know? And just, um, just, um, remember to, um, just state your name and the date before you start.
Skyler: Hank, do... do we have to– have to do this right now?
Hank: No, we—we don't have to do this right now. No.
[Hank turns off the recording device.]
Hank: But just here's the thing. You see, I need something solid that I can bring to my people. A statement on the record. So you testifying to Walt's criminal activities – whatever you know – can go a long, long way here. Okay, I mean, you see, building a case this big, gathering all this evidence, enough to get a conviction– we're talking a long-haul proposition here. And I don't want that bastard running out the clock. But with your testimony—
Skyler: Wait, what do you mean "running out the clock?"
Hank: His cancer. His cancer's back. So he said. He didn't tell you? Who's to say it's even true? Lying piece of shit. Look, regardless, I mean, we'll just assume. Fine. Okay? You know what? That son of a bitch looks me in the eye and he says if what I know is true, if... he'll be dead before I can prove it. The balls on that son of a– I got all these little pieces. They're all part of the story, right? But they don't mean much on their own. But when you start telling me what you know, when you start filling the gaps, I'll have him in lockup before the sun goes down.

Skyler: Hank, I... I... I think maybe... maybe I need a lawyer.
Hank: What? No, no, no, no, you don't.
Skyler: I– I think maybe I do.
Hank: Skyler, understand, I am here to help you. But to do that, I need your help. We start bringing in lawyers and they start putting up roadblocks where they don't need to be, and my ability to control the situation diminishes.
Skyler: Just for my own protection. It just, you know, it seems to make sense that I should have someone to talk to.
Hank: Skyler, I am your– your biggest advocate here, and I'm telling you, for your own good, you need to get out ahead of this thing. I mean, you start – you know – getting defensive, I– I'm not saying it's right, but I'll tell you it's a fact. The D.A. will look at you differently.
Skyler: But you don't know that.
Hank: Skyler, yes, I–I do. I've been around long enough to know. It's in your best interest to get out there and show the world you have nothing to hide. Look, no one in the world is more important to me than your sister. So believe me when I tell you that your best interest and mine are the same.
Skyler: But Hank, you telling me not to talk to a lawyer doesn't sound like that at all. It sounds like what you want... what you want is to get Walt at all costs.
Hank: Okay. Okay. Let's just slow down. Slow down. You can. You can talk to a lawyer later. But right now, what we need to do, we need to go get the kids, we need to bring them to my house where they are safe. And then we need to help each other put this animal away, okay?

In fact, why do you still have a battery in that thing? Take it out. They might be trying to triangulate your movements. I'm not being paranoid. Do it.
Walter: Can't believe she went to him.
Saul: She just panicked.
Walter: She went right to him without even talking to me. Without a moment's hesitation.
Saul: I'm not saying it's not bad. It's bad. But it could be worse.
Walter: Really, how much worse could it be? Exactly, in your estimation?
Saul: What does she actually know? What has she seen, hmm? Nothing. It's hearsay. It's all he said, she said. I mean, the only real evidence that she can lead them to is the money, and once we take care of that, well, then they got nothing.
Walter: Nothing. Hank knows, that is not nothing.

Walter: Just tell me. I know you talked with Hank. I know you made a deal. Skyler, I'll make this easy. I'll give myself up if you promise me one thing: you keep the money. Never speak of it, never give it up. You pass it on to our children, give them everything. Will you do that? Please? Please, don't let me have done all this for nothing.
Skyler: The way Hank talks, he's got his suspicions. Not much else. You can't give yourself up without giving up the money. That's the way this works, Walt. So maybe our best move here is to stay quiet.

Hank: Oh, yeah. That's the look. Lucky for you, I'm more interested in him. So I got an offer. If you help me out here, tell me all about you and him and your little meth business, maybe I talk to my friends at the APD and make all this go away. I know he's the mastermind here. Plus...

Jesse: Why don't you try and beat it out of me? That's your thing, right?

I don't think, uh, Walt's gonna be patting you on the back for that. But maybe that's the point. 'Cause, you see, I get that. My own brother-in-law, lying to me for over a year, using me.

[Hank and Marie watch Walter's "confession" tape at home]
Walter: My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a "hit" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in "Blood Money."] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.

Hank: $177,000? Hell's he talking about? Marie?

Hank: What was gambling money? Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie. Oh, God, no.
Marie: How was I supposed to know? How was I supposed to know where it really came from?
Hank: Why were they paying for my medical bills? What about my insurance?
Marie: Insurance wouldn't have covered the treatment that you needed, and I... I just wanted the best for you–
Hank: Why didn't you tell me?
Marie: Because I knew that you would refuse it, and without it, you may never have been able to walk again.
Hank: Oh, Christ, Marie. You killed me here. I mean, it's the– that's the last nail. That's the last nail in the coffin.

Jack: Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.
Walter: You weren’t supposed to be here.
Jack: Too late now. How about you telling me what was going down out here? Hmm? Yeah, you and your brother-in-law don’t seem to be getting along too well.
Walter: It doesn’t– doesn’t matter. It doesn’t concern you.
Jack: We just wasted his partner here and he’s wearing a bullet, so yeah, I’d say it does concern me.
Walter: This is... between him and me.
Jack: No cavalry comin’?
Walter: No.
Hank: You bet your ass the cavalry’s comin’.
Walter: [to Jack] No! No, no. Jack, Jack! No. The DEA doesn’t know about this. Not yet. [to Hank] Hank, nothing can change what just happened, but you can walk out of here alive if you just promise us that you’ll– you’ll let this go.
[Hank scoffs.]
Jack: Yeah, I thought as much. Sorry, man, just no scenario where this guy lives.
Walter: No, no, no, listen! I have money! It’s buried right here. It’s here. It’s $80 million. $80 million.
Jack: So, that’s what got this party started, huh? But this money of yours won’t do me much good in prison.
Walter: You can– you can go anywhere. You can do anything. Just think about that. You can have any future that you want. Jack. Eighty. Million. All you’ve got to do is let him go.
Kenny: That’s a hell of an offer.
Jack: [to Hank] What do you think, Fed? Would you take that deal?
Walter: It's Hank. His name is Hank.
Jack: How about it, Hank? Should I let you go?
Hank: My name is ASAC Schrader. And you can go fuck yourself.
Walter: Hank... listen to me. You gotta tell him. You gotta tell him now that we can work this out. Please. Please.
Hank: What? You want me to beg? You're the smartest guy I ever met. And you're too stupid to see... he made up his mind ten minutes ago. [to Jack] Do what you're gonna do–
[Jack shoots Hank.]

Skyler: I’ll be asking myself that for the rest of my life.
Walter Jr.: So you’re saying all of this time you were lying about this? I mean, so you’re saying… you’re a liar. You… you just admitted it. So were you lying then, or are you lying now? Which lie is it?
Marie: Flynn, honey, your mother is telling you the truth. Right here, right now. Believe it.

Marie: Your dad’s in custody. You won’t be able to talk to him for a while, sweetie.
Walter Jr.: I am calling uncle Hank.

Walter: What the hell is wrong with you? Why can't you do one thing I say?
Skyler: What?

[Walter and Saul are in the basement of Ed's vacuum repair shop.]
Walter: ...What?
Saul: Nothing.
Walter: You know what, make yourself useful. Give me a list of hitters, mercenaries. Yes, yes, I remember – you've got "concerns." Don't worry, we'll take the time to vet them. Make sure there are no undercover cops on the team. Five should do it, providing they're the right men for the job.
Saul: I'm gonna hate myself for asking, but who are we hitting?
Walter: Jack Welker and his men. They murdered Hank. They stole my life's work.
Saul: I don't know any hitmen.
Walter: You know a guy who knows a guy– Just give me the contacts. Anybody in that world. I'm paying top dollar. We'll find them.
Saul: You mind if I give you a nickel's worth of advice, just for old times' sake? You're worried about your wife and kids? Don't leave. The way things are right now, some people – not me, mind you, but some people – might say you're leaving her high and dry.
Walter: "Some people" would be ignorant on the facts. "Some people" wouldn't know that as far as the police are concerned, Skyler is a blameless victim.
[Saul scoffs and waves off Walter.]
Walter: No no no, go ahead. Get it off your chest. Go on.
Saul: The phone call was a smart move. Kudos to you. Odds are it was recorded. It's gonna play great for a jury. It might even buy her a mistrial – in a year and a half. Until then, if they don't have you, they're going after her.
Walter: There's no point. She knows nothing.
Saul: Well too bad for her, then she's got nothing to trade. I hate to be a downer here, but there are two DEA agents missing, presumed dead. You think the Feds are gonna just let that go 'cause you hit the ejector seat? First thing they're gonna do, they will RICO your wife and kids out of the house. That condo is gone. Your bank accounts, they're frozen. Her picture's probably on TV right now, next to yours. Who's gonna hire her?
Walter: Money's no problem.
Saul: Well, I don't mean to contradict you, but getting it to her? Impossible. The Feds are just praying that you'll make contact. The Internet, the phone, it's all tapped. Hey, Mike was no dummy. But every time he tried to get his nest egg to his granddaughter, it ended up in Uncle Sam's pockets.
Walter: So you propose what?
Saul: Stay. Face the music. Hey, I mean, how much time have you got left? You walk in with your head held high, you'll be the John Dillinger of Metropolitan Detention Center...
Walter: No, no, no...
Saul: ...How bad is that? And you bring a barrel full of drug money, maybe that soothes some troubled waters. Maybe they let your family stay in the house. After all, the house predates the criminal enterprise–
Walter: God, do you think I want to run?! That's the last thing that I want! This... this changes nothing. What I do I do for my family. My money goes to my children! Not just this barrel – all of it! I'm going to kill Jack and his entire crew, and I'm going to take back what is mine and give it to my children, and then – and only then – am I through! Do you understand?
[Ed enters the room.]
Ed: Everything good?
Saul: Define "good."
Ed: You're set. Time to go. [To Walter.] You'll be a little longer. Still working on transportation.

But the reason were always… Things happened that… I– I never… intended. I never intended. Listen. Son, we don’t have much time. Is Louis’ family still at 4848 Newcombe? Son, your friend Louis Corbett, does his family still live in that same place up on Newcombe?
Walter Jr.: Y–yes.
Walter: Okay, good. Okay, he’s– he’s a good kid. He’s– he’s like you. He’ll understand. I’m sending Louis a package. Now, it’s addressed to Louis, but it’s for you, your mother and your sister. There’s– there’s money inside. About $100,000. Okay? I think. It was all that I could fit into the box. It has to be a secret. And if anyone says a word, the police will take it. I wanted to give you so much more. But this is all I could do. Do you understand? Son? Can you hear me? Do you understand?

Charlie Rose: [on television as Walter watches] But just yesterday, your charity, the Gretchen & Elliott Schwartz Foundation, announced a $28 million grant for drug abuse treatment centers throughout the Southwest.
Elliott: Charlie, the Southwest is our home, and we couldn't just ignore what's going on in our own backyard.
Charlie: But I'm sure you're aware that there are people who suggest other motives. Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times wrote a column suggesting that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver to shore up the stock price of Gray Matter Technologies because of your association with Walter White.
Elliott: Well, that's not exactly the way...
Charlie: To cleanse yourself, so to speak, of having a methamphetamine kingpin as co-founder of your company.
Elliott: Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up. I have to believe that the investing public understands we're talking about a person who was there early on, but who had virtually nothing to do with the creation of the company, and still less to do with growing it into what it is today.
Charlie: So what was Walter White's contribution?
Elliott: You know, to be honest... Honey?
Gretchen: The company name.
Elliott: The company name. We came up with it by combining our names. Schwartz means black, black plus white makes gray.
Charlie: Hence, Gray Matter Technologies.
Elliott: Exactly. As far as I can recall, his contribution begins and ends right there.
Charlie: There are continuing reports of blue methamphetamine, considered his signature product throughout the Southwest, and some evidence of reaching as far as Europe. So my question is: is Walter White still out there?
Gretchen: No, he's not.
Charlie: You sound very sure.
Gretchen: I am. I can't speak for this Heisenberg that people refer to, but whatever... whatever he became, the sweet, kind, brilliant man that we once knew, long ago, he's gone.

Gretchen: Where did it come from? And why is it here?
Walter: I earned it. And you’re going to give it to my children.
Gretchen: What? Why?
Elliott: Walt, I don’t think we–
Walter: On my son’s 18th birthday, which is 10 months and 2 days from today, you will give him this money in the form of an irrevocable trust. You will tell him it is his to do with as he sees fit, but with the hope that he uses it for his college education and for the betterment of his family.
Elliott: Walt, I’m not sure that we follow. Why, um, I mean, why, in particular, would we–
Gretchen: If you wanna give your kids drug money, go do it yourself.
Walter: I can’t. My wife and son hate me. They won’t take my money. Even if they did, the federal government wouldn’t let them. But two rich benefactors, who are known for their charitable endeavors, who would think nothing of, for instance, writing a $28 million check to help victims of methamphetamine abuse. I have to think that your money would be very welcome.
Gretchen: It wouldn’t make any sense coming from us.
Walter: It certainly would. My children are blameless victims of their monstrous father, a man who you once knew quite well. Call it a beau geste. Call it liberal guilt. Call it whatever you want, but do it. And you are not to spend a single dime of your own money. If there are taxes or lawyers’ fees owed, you will take it right from here. They use my money, never yours.
Elliott: Okay, Walt, sure. That– that sounds reasonable. So what happens next?
Walter: I guess we shake on it. And I leave.
[Walter shakes hand with Elliott and Gretchen. He walks up to them.]
Walter: I can trust you to do this.
Elliott: Yes. Absolutely you can.
[Walter turns to the window and signals someone to point red laser at Elliott and Gretchen. They shake and scream.]
Walter: Don’t move, Don’t… Don’t dare move a muscle. You don’t want them to think that you’re trying to get away. Just breathe. Just this afternoon, I had an extra $200,000 that I would have loved dearly to leave on top of this table. Instead, I gave it to the two best hitmen west of the Mississippi. Now, whatever happens to me tomorrow, they’ll still be out there keeping tabs. And if, for any reason, that my children do not get this money, a kind of… countdown will begin. Maybe a day or so later, maybe a week, a year, when you’re going for a walk in Santa Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever. And you’re… talking about your stock prices… without a worry in the world, and then suddenly, you’ll hear the scrape of a footstep behind you, and before you can even turn around, pop!
[Elliott and Gretchen scream.]
Walter: Darkness. [putting his arms around Elliott and Gretchen] Cheer up, beautiful people. This is where you get to make it right.
