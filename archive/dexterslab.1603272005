Dexter: Stop! If there was a message so important that it would require time travel, I would certainly not entrust it to my idiot sister. I would send myself. In other words...[Shouting] I would not send you back in time even if..! If..if...[Shouting] I was being eaten alive!
DeeDee: [Sobbing] Oh Dexter! Why are you being so terrible?!
Dexter: Please...I have no time for your tears. Why don't you go back outside and talk to trees or whatever it is you do?
DeeDee: Fine! I will! And I'm not ever giving you the message! [Runs out of the lab, crying]
