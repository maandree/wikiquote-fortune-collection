Castiel: And I, you. Sam Winchester...The boy with the demon blood. Glad to hear you’ve ceased your extracurricular activities.
Uriel: Let’s keep it that way.
Dean: Yeah, okay, chuckles. Who’s your friend?
Castiel: This raising of Samhain, have you stopped it?
Dean: Why?
Castiel: Dean, have you located the witch?
Dean: Yes, we’ve located the witch.
Castiel: And is the witch dead?
Sam: No, but...
Dean: We know who it is.
Castiel: Apparently the witch knows who you are too. This was inside the wall of your room. If we hadn’t found it, surely one or both of you would be dead. Do you know where the witch is now?
Dean: We’re working on it.
Castiel: That’s unfortunate.
Dean: What do you care?
Castiel: The raising of Samhain is one of the 66 seals.
Dean: So this is about your buddy Lucifer.
Uriel: Lucifer is no friend of ours.
Dean: It’s just an expression.
Castiel: Lucifer cannot rise, the breaking of the seal must be prevented at all costs.
Dean: Okay, great, well now that you’re here, why don’t you tell us where the witch is, we’ll gank her and everybody goes home.
Castiel: We are not omniscient, this witch is very powerful, she’s cloaked even our methods.
Sam: Okay, we already know who she is, so if we work together-
Uriel: Enough of this.
Dean: Okay, who are you and why should I care?
Castiel: This is Uriel, he’s what you might call... a specialist.
Dean: What kind of specialist? What are you gonna do?
Castiel: You...uh both of you, you need to leave this town immediately.
Dean: Why?
Castiel: Because we’re about to destroy it.
Dean: So this is your plan, you’re gonna smite the whole friggin’ town?
Castiel: We’re out of time, this witch has to die, the seal must be saved.
Sam: There are a thousand people here.
Uriel: One thousand two hundred fourteen.
Sam: And you’re willing to kill them all?
Uriel: This isn’t the first time I’ve…purified a city.
Castiel: Look, I understand this is regrettable.
Dean: Regrettable?
Castiel: We have to hold the line; too many seals have broken already.
Dean: So you screw the pooch on some seals and now this town has to pay the price?
Castiel: It’s the lives of one thousand against the lives of six billion, there’s a bigger picture here.
Dean: Right, cause you’re bigger picture kind of guys.
Castiel: Lucifer cannot rise, he does and hell rises with him. Is that something that you’re willing to risk?
Sam: We'll stop this witch before she summons anyone. Your seal won't be broken and no one has to die.
Uriel: We're wasting time with these mud monkeys.
Castiel: I’m sorry, but we have our orders.
Sam: No, you can’t do this, you’re... you're angels, I mean aren’t you supposed to- You’re supposed to show mercy.
Uriel: Says who?
Castiel: We have no choice.
Dean: Of course you have a choice, I mean, come on, what? You’ve never-you've never questioned a crap order, huh? What are you both just a couple of hammers?
Castiel: Look, even if you can’t understand it, have faith, the plan is just.
Sam: How can you even say that?
Castiel: Because it comes from heaven, that makes it just.
Dean: Oh, it must be nice, to be so sure of yourselves.
Castiel: Tell me something Dean, when your father gave you an order, didn’t you obey?
Dean: Well sorry boys, looks like the plans have changed.
Uriel: You think you can stop us?
Dean: No, but if you’re gonna smite this whole town, then you’re gonna have to smite us with it, because we are not leaving. See, you went to the trouble of busting me out of hell, I figure I’m worth something to the man upstairs. You wanna waste me? Go ahead, see how he digs that.
Uriel: I will drag you out of here myself.
Dean: Yeah, but you’ll have to kill me, then we’re back to the same problem. I mean, come on, you're gonna wipe out a whole town for one little witch. Sounds to me like you're compensating for something. We can do this, we will find that witch and we will stop the summoning.
Uriel: Castiel! I will not let these peop-
Castiel: Enough! I suggest you move quickly.

Castiel: Our orders were not to stop the summoning of Samhain, they were to do whatever you told us to do.
Dean: Your orders were to follow my orders?
Castiel: It was a test, to see how you would perform under... battlefield conditions, you might say.
Dean: It was a witch, not the Tet Offensive. So I uh- failed your test, huh? I get it. But you know what? If you would have waved that-that magic time traveling wand of yours and we had to do it all over again, I’d make the same call. Cause see, I don’t know what’s gonna happen when these seals are broken, hell I don’t even know what’s gonna happen tomorrow. But what I do know is, that this, here? These kids, the swings, the trees, all of it is still here because of my brother and me.
Castiel: You misunderstand me Dean. I’m not like you think, I was praying that you would choose to save the town.
Dean: You were?
Castiel: These people, they’re all my father’s creations. They’re works of art, and yet, even though you stopped Samhain, the seal was broken and we are one step closer to hell on earth, for all creation. Now that’s not an expression Dean, its a literal. You of all people should appreciate what that means. Can I tell you something if you promise not to tell another soul?
Dean: Okay.
Castiel: I’m not a…hammer as you say. I have questions, I...I have doubts. I don’t know what is right and what is wrong anymore, whether you passed or failed here. But in the coming months you will have more decisions to make. I don’t envy the weight that’s on your shoulders Dean. I truly don’t.

Alastair: You think I’ll see all your scary toys and spill my guts?

Alastair: ... but he said nein, each and every time... Damned if I couldn’t break him. Pulled out all the stops. But John, he was made of something unique, the stuff of heroes. And then came Dean. Dean Winchester. I thought I was up against it again. But, daddy’s little girl, he broke. He broke in thirty. Ah, just not the man your daddy wanted you to be, huh, Dean? No. Now we’re getting somewhere. Holy water? Come on. Grasshopper, you’re gonna have to get creative to impress me.

Dean: You're lying.
Alastair: "And it is written that the first seal shall be broken when a righteous man sheds blood in hell. As he breaks, so shall it break." We had to break the first seal before any others, only way to get the dominoes to fall, right? Top of the one at the front of the line. When we win, when we bring on the Apocalypse and burn this earth down, we'll owe it all to you, Dean Winchester. Believe me, son, I wouldn't lie about that.

Sam: Why are you here, Jess?
Jess: Would you believe I'm actually trying to protect you?
Sam: From what?
Jess: You. Sooner or later, the past is gonna catch up to you like it always does. You know what happens then? People die. Baby, the people closest to you die.
Sam: Well don't worry, because I won't make that mistake again.
Jess: Same song, different verse. Things are never gonna change with you. Never.

Gabriel: Lucifer... you are my brother, and I love you. But you are a great big bag of dicks.
Lucifer: What did you say to me?
Gabriel: Look at yourself... Boo hoo, Daddy was mean to me, so I'm gonna smash up all his toys.
Lucifer: Watch your tone.
Gabriel: Play the victim all you want, but you and me, we know the truth. Dad loved you best, more than Michael, more than me. Then he brought the new baby home and you couldn't handle it. So all of this is just a great big temper tantrum. Time to grow up.

Gabriel: [to Sam and Dean] Without me, you got zero shot at killing Lucifer. Sorry. But... you can trap him. The cage you sprung Lucifer from, it's still down there, and maybe, just maybe, you can shove his ass back in. Not that it'll be easy. You got to get the cage open, trick my bro back into it, and, uh, oh yeah, avoid Michael and the God Squad. But hey - details, right? And here's the big secret, Lucifer himself doesn't even know. But the key to the cage, it's out there. Actually it's keys, plural, four keys. Well, four rings... from the Horsemen. You get 'em all, you got the cage.

Chuck: In between jobs, Sam and Dean would sometimes get a day--sometimes a week, if they were lucky. They'd pass the time lining their pockets. Sam used to insist on honest work, but now he hustles pool, like his brother. They could go anywhere and do anything. They drove a thousand miles for an Ozzy show. Two days for a Jayhawks game. And when it was clear, they'd park her in the middle of nowhere, sit on the hood, and watch the stars... for hours... without saying a word.

Chuck: This is the last Dean and Bobby will see of each other for a very long time. And for the record, at this point next week, Bobby will be hunting a Roogaru outside of Dayton. But not Dean.

Chuck: So what's it all add up to? It's hard to say. But me, I'd say this was a test... for Sam and Dean. And I think they did all right.

But really, really... it was your storytelling. That is the true flower of free will, at least as you've mastered it so far. When you create stories, you become gods of tiny intricate dimensions unto themselves. So many worlds. I have read as much as it's possible for an angel to read, and I haven't caught up.

Sam: I don't know. Like, something to you. Look... I'm thinking until we know for sure that we're gonna kill off Crowley, why don't we store the Blade somewhere distant? Lock it up somewhere safe? Okay?

So they prayed harder and longer and fought more wars in His name. And for what?ǃ So they could die of malaria? Leukaemia?

You have to believe me. When I suggested you take on the Mark of Cain, I didn't know this was going to happen. Not really. I mean, I might not have told you the entire truth. But I never lied. I never lied, Dean. That's important. It's fundamental. But...there is one story about Cain that I might have... forgotten to tell you. Apparently, he, too, was willing to accept death, rather than becoming the killer the Mark wanted him to be. So he took his own life with the Blade. He died. Except, as rumor has it, the Mark never quite let go. You can understand why I never spoke of this. Why set hearts aflutter at mere speculation? It wasn't until you summoned me... No, it wasn't truly until you left that cheeseburger uneaten...that I began to let myself believe. Maybe miracles do come true.

Castiel: Where is all this coming from?
Hannah: Being on Earth, working with you. I felt things, human things -- passions, hungers. To shower, feel water on my skin, to get closer to you. But all of that was nothing compared to what I felt when I saw him. Her husband, his anger and his grief. Caroline was inside me screaming out for him, for her life back. These feelings they aren't for me, for us. They belong to her. I know it's time to step aside... Goodbye Castiel.

Dean: Hey look no judgement from me, just not where we eat.
Sam: Dude, it wasn't porn.
Dean: Okay, erotica whatever. Just zip it up.

Dean: Sam! I know what you're doing over there, and it ain't porn. Look man, we have checked every website, okay we checked it twice. Sam when we work a case, there's always that-that point where we have to face the truth, right? Even if we don't like it. Well truth is, there's no way around this. We saw what happened to Cain, okay. I'm not happy about it, but I gotta move on. So I'm gonna keep doing we what do... while I still can, and I'd like you to be there with me.

Cole: Damn. Day in day out, you and Sammy saving people from things they just can't wrap their minds around, and nobody even notices. At least I get a medal for my efforts, but you... I tried to kill your ass.
Dean: Well, good times.

Dean: Maybe, he was human before he was a monster.
Cole: I get it, why you did it Dean. My Dad wasn't my dad anymore, if I go down that same road, I want you to do that to me too.
Dean: That road? That means giving up. If you think that's where your headed, then you've got it ass backwards. You're gonna fight, harder then you ever have. You understand.
Cole: I appreciate the talk coach, but honestly all I can think about is slicing open your wrists and drinking you like a fountain. I guess that makes me a monster, don't it?

Dean: Don't blame yourself for Kit, man.
Sam: I can't help it Dean, it feels crappy.
Dean: I know it does.
Sam: I tried, I did, I tried. But I couldn't save this one.
Dean: You know you can do everything right, and even still sometimes, the guy still dies.

Father Delaney: Is there anything else on your mind Agent Allman?
Dean: What if I said I... I didn’t want to die... yet. And that I wasn’t ready.
Father Delaney: Are you expecting to?
Dean: Always. The life I live, the work I do, I pretty much just figured that was all there was to me. You know, tearing around and jam the key in the ignition and haul ass till I ran out of gas. I guess I just thought, sooner or later I’d go out the same way that I live. Pedal to the metal and that would be it.
Father Delaney: But Now?
Dean: Now, em, recent events made me think I may be closer to that than I really thought. And, I don’t know, I mean there’s... there’s things, there’s... people, feelings that I-I-I want to experience differently than I have before, or maybe even for the first time.
Father Delaney: Go a little deeper perhaps than with Gina
Dean: Yeah, yeah I’m just starting to think that, maybe there’s more to it all than I thought.
Father Delaney: Learning there’s more to the universe than your tiny world can be a frightening discovery. You truly believe in God agent? Because that can be a comfort.
Dean: I believe there is a God... But I’m not sure he still believes in us.

Sam: I heard what Sister Matthias was saying about, you know, hiding pain by taking on a mission. And I... I know what you’re doing a little bit, and it’s okay. I mean, it’s fine, I get it, I’ve done it before too. But I don’t buy for one second that the mark is terminal diagnosis, so don’t go making peace with that idea, there has to be a way, there will be a way and we will find it, that’s what we do. So believe that.
Dean: Okay Sammy.
Sam: You wanna try that again like you mean it?
Dean: Okay.
