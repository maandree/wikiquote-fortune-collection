Instructor: Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress—and a volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here, we see the Stevens family enjoying on their picnic. But suddenly, daughter hears a noise: it's a volcano. Junior seems worried—but have no fear, Junior. Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt. [Jane uses a picnic blanket, covering her family] That's right, Jane—duck and cover.

Brunet: Well. The most likely reason is that somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.
Blond: Yep.
Sheila: What?!
Brunet: Uh-huh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak.
Blond: Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable.
Sheila: Oh, dear God!
Brunet: Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.
Sheila: [sadly rubs her eyes] Oooh.
Blond: Now, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it.
Sheila: Ooooh!
Brunet: Yes. And, now for the difficult part.

Rebecca: What means kiss?
Kyle: When a man and a woman feel...love, they put their lips together.

Announcer of the ADA: Fellow dentists! As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth-fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this: A giant half-chicken, half-squirrel, that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest, for genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring. We believe also, that the creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra, and that it...
Dr Foley: Excuse me, I think I have a more logical theory!
Announcer: Well, by all means, Mr Foley, enlighten us!
Dr Foley: I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit!
Announcer: [all laughing] Oh, Mr Foley! You realize how ridiculous that sounds?
Dr Foley: It's not ridiculous, it's very possible. I've seen it happen before!
Announcer: Where?
Dr Foley: In Montreal.
Announcer: [more laughing] And where, pray, is this "Montreal"?
Dr Foley: Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!
Announcer: Very well, Mr Foley! You go on your wild goose chase, and meanwhile we'll deal with the real problems at hand.
Dr Foley: I will! [leaves]
Announcer: Ha ha ha! Anyway, the half-chicken, half-squirrel would most likely be about 3-4.5 feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a floatation device.

He just can't get over it. So he doesn't care who he takes: children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand?
Stan: Then why does God give us anything to start with?
Chef: Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first, you give it a lollipop. Then, you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then you would have nothing to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and health, just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears.

But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop."

But I have a great life and a great family and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up. Because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls.

Ms. Garrison: Now, I for one think that evolution is a bunch of bullcrap, but I'm told I have to teach it anyway. It was thought up by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this. In the beginning we were all fish, okay, swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So retard fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its mutant fish hands, and it had butt-sex with a squirrel or something, and made this...retard frog-squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a monkey-fish-frog, and then this monkey-fish-frog had butt-sex with that monkey; that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and that made you. So there you go. You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt-sex with a fish-squirrel, congratulations!

Doctor: Well, just don't let it happen again! Now, I'm just going to check for cysts. (Again, he assumes the position. Again, Katherine queefs. Again, they both laugh hysterically. Now he's really mad...) Now, stop it! That isn't funny! Babies come from there! (Once again, he assumes the position. Need we elaborate on what happens next? He slams down his notepad in disgust.)

Doctor (unmoved): You should have thought about that before you queefed in my face three times!

Butters (confused): They aren't gonna show Part Two of The Terrance and Philip Show?
(Back to the gyno's office.)
Katie: Doctor, my sister's just being difficult. Maybe you could examine my cervix instead!
Doctor: Well, all right...Now I'm just going to check for cysts... (You know the rest. Thoroughly repulsed, he throws down his notepad again.) That does it, Queef Sisters! I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore! (He storms out of the exam room, slamming the door behind him.)

Katie (innocently): I guess so, Katherine...

Cartman: Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?
(Cut to a two shot of Terrance and Philip in the office of Brian, the President of the Canada Channel. They've also been watching the Queef Sisters special, and they would like to know the same thing Cartman wants to know...)
Philip: What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
Terrance (equally disgusted): Queef Sisters?!
Brian: That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.
Terrance (incredulous): You replaced our show with this? But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
Philip: That's sick!
Brian: You think farts are funny, why not queefs?
Terrance (annoyed because it's so obvious): Because babies come from there!
Brian: Hey, look, guys! Women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience--you know, women empowerment and the get-go! So we want to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry, guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gone stale!

Randy (wary): What was that?
Sharon: Oh...excuse me...(barely stifling a giggle) I had some air trapped. (Shelly knows exactly what her mother means, and she can't suppress her own giggle. Randy, however, is somewhat less than appreciative of how funny that was.)
Randy (disgusted): Oh, my God, did you just...at the table?
Stan (equally grossed out): Gross, Mom! (Seeing Randy and Stan's disgust only sets Sharon and Shelly to giggling again.)
Randy (stern and paternal): Okay, that's enough, girls, all right?! I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
Sharon (trying to sound relatively contrite): Sorry. It's just...it's just pretty funny how much it bothers you. (Apparently the humor is lost on the masculine portion of the Marsh family.)
Randy (sarcastic): Oh, yeah, yeah, that's really funny!
Stan: Stop it, Mom!
Randy: Yea, okay? Let"s just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
Sharon: Okay, I'm sorry. (They go back to eating again in silence. A couple seconds later, another queef can be heard. This time, both Sharon and Shelly crack up.)

Philip: You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
Katherine: Fuck you, you don't fucking slap me! (The lights come on to reveal Terrance and Katie in the other bed.)
Terrance: Can you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here!
Philip: She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!
Terrance (thoroughly repulsed): Sick!!
Katie (gamely): Well, what's the big deal?. I've been queefing in this bed the entire time! (Terrance does a double-take.)
Terrance: WHAT?!!! GROSS!!! (He slaps Katie.)
Katie: How dare you!!! (She punches Terrance right in the face. Both women start pushing them to the door.)
Katherine (screeching hysterically): GET OUT! GET OUT, BOTH OF YOU!!! WE NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!!! (They shove Terrance and Philip through the threshold and onto the porch.)'
Terrance (dumbfounded): After all we've been through? (He gets his answer from the door suddenly slammed in their face. The two sisters hug each other, crying and queefing in equal measure.)
(Cut to the porch. Terrance and Philip are smoking cigarettes and bemoaning their position.)
Terrance (sighing): What the hell am I going to do, Philip? She makes me so mad sometimes!
Philip: Katherine just won't stop queefing...but I don't know if could live without her...
(Cut back to the bedroom. The Queef Sisters are still crying and queefing, when Terrance and Philip come back in.)
Philip (contrite): Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
Terrance (equally contrite): Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.
Katherine (runs to hug Terrance): Oh, Terrance...
Katie (doing the same with Philip): Philip! (Both couples get back in their respective beds and start getting their Canadian freak on, and soon the room is a cacophony of farts and queefs.)

Kyle: That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show, but it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
Jesus: That's right. Don't you see, gingers, if you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.
Santa: That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.

Today I'm going to be dippin some Vagisil regular strength anti-itch cream. [Drinks some Vagisil] So I'm pissed off what I found out. I found out this Obama wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!

Dr. Chinstrap: Hello, everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I'm a hoarding specialist, and today, we're gonna help Stan clean out his locker. All right, let's go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan.
[Stan opens his locker, which is quite stuffed. There are gasps of shock all around, and Wendy starts crying]
Stan: What? Come on, it's not that bad.
Dr. Chinstrap: Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control, or his psychosis will come out.
Stan: "My psychosis?" Look, it isn't that big of a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
Dr. Chinstrap: Okay, great. Now how about we start with this... [takes out a pencil box]
Stan: Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
Dr. Chinstrap: Okay, okay, we'll put that right here on the floor. [places box down and takes out a broken toothbrush] Now, how about this? Broken toothbrush?
Stan: Well, it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I...
Dr. Chinstrap: But it's broken.
Stan: Yeah, but it works perfectly fine, and it...
Dr. Chinstrap: Okay, okay, broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box. [places it down and takes out a maggot-infested sandwich] Now, how about this? Old sandwich in a baggie, filled with maggots? [there are groans of disgust from all those present]
Stan: [faltering slightly] Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean, I kinda need that, let's just keep that.
Dr. Chinstrap: It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?
Stan: [faltering further] Well I might need it if I ever have to, you know, like...
Dr. Chinstrap: The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?
Stan: [starting to lose his nerve] Well, I - I guess so but... [as the sandwich is thrown in the baggie] W-w-wait, this is all happening a little fast, can we just slow down?

Stan: Well no, don't throw that out!
