Goes all the way up into the sky then falls all the way back down onto me. Contraceptives in the rain. Love this planet. Still, at least I won't get pregnant. Never doing that again.

Ianto: Do you ever think that one day your luck'll run out? That you won't come back?
Jack: I'm a fixed point in time and space. That's what the Doctor says. I think that means it's forever.
Ianto: So, one day you'll see me die... of old age... and just keep going?
Jack: Yeah...
Ianto: We'd better make the most of it then.
Jack: Yeah. Suppose.
Ianto: [slyly] Like...right now?
Jack: [pauses, then grins] Ianto, the world could be ending.
Ianto: World's always ending. And I have missed that coat.
Jack: [grins, and turns to Rhys] Rhys, do you want to take the car down to those shops by the Wharf? We need some discs for these things. Should take about twenty minutes.

Members of the public have gathered outside the Montrose Hill State Penitentiary, but the planned protests against the death sentence have failed to appear.

Esther: Could be just a coincidence, I suppose.
Dr. Juarez: That's what I said, yeah. Then I was on a call to St. Jude's in Chicago. They said, "Well, here's a funny thing. Past twenty-four hours, we've registered no deaths." Not one. So I called my ex-husband - he's at Cedar Brook - same story. All day, no deaths. I tried London. I have this friend at the Royal Free Hospital. I called her. She said, "Oh, that's weird.

Oswald: The truth is I know what I am. I know what you are too. Yes, I do. Each and every one of you. Because I know for certain what has happened to the human race. I know, because this has happened before. Fifty thousand years BC. What's called the great leap forward. Human beings suddenly, we started to bury our dead. We created art and money. And love. They loved. They learned to love. We made a leap from animal to human. And now, right now, in our very own lifetimes it has happened again. The next great leap. We have made it from animal to human to what? This is the question. After Miracle Day, what are we now? I know. This is something I know. Because I am the man who has lost Heaven forever. So I can feel the truth of it. I'm telling you, man has risen again! Now, he has a new name. And his name is Angel. Angel. Angel. We are angels. We have been helped. We have been purified. We have been given life unending. We are the first angels on Earth. And I promise you this, there are even those who have been planning for this. The agents of angels in this brand new world. I'm telling you right now, they stand amongst us. Yes! For this is my revelation!

And we're gonna expose everything that's going on here. Everything that I've just witnessed. [...] They're calling them category one's, and from what I've seen, don't ever let them call you that. The minute you hear "category one," you better get the hell out of Dodge. Because they are going to burn you. That's what this place is for. Incineration. And we all know the drill.

Turned out money'd gone missing from work and he got the blame. So I went to get all my pocket money and I put it in his hand. Must have been about two pound fifty. He looked at me and said it wasn't about the money. He said "I can't stand anyone thinking I'm not an honest man," and I've always remembered that. Always. Because that was the first time in my life anybody had spoken to me like an adult. And then we went to the back garden and we played until dark. So that's my dad.
