Opening narration: History has known many great liars. Copernicus. Goebbels. St. Ralph the Liar. [he is shown holding a sign which reads "St. Benedict the Liar"] But there have been none quite so vile as the Tudor King Henry VII. It was he who rewrote history to portray his predecessor, Richard III, as a deformed maniac who killed his nephews in the Tower. But the real truth is that Richard was a kind and thoughtful man who cherished his young wards, in particular Richard, Duke of York, who grew into a big, strong boy. Henry also claimed he won the Battle of Bosworth Field and killed Richard III. Again, the truth is very different; for it was Richard, Duke of York, who became king after Bosworth Field, and reigned for thirteen glorious years. As for who really killed Richard III and how the defeated Henry Tudor escaped with his life, all is revealed in this, the first chapter of a history never before told: the history of... the Black Adder!

Baldrick: With you at the helm, my lord, we cannot lose.
Percy: Well, we could if we wanted to.
Prince Edmund: Ah, but we won't, Percy. And I shall prove to all that I am a man!
Percy: But you are a man.

Edmund: Well, well, let's take Hell: You know, Hell isn't as bad as it's cracked up to be.
Graveney: What?
Edmund: No, no, no, no. No, you see, the thing about Heaven, is that Heaven is for people who like the sort of things that go on in Heaven, like, uh, well, singing, talking to God, watering pot plants...
Graveney: Ew...
Edmund: Whereas Hell, on the other hand, is for people who like the other sorts of things: [with relish] adultery, pillage, torture — those... areas.
Graveney: Really?
Edmund: Mm! Leave your lands to the Crown, and once you're dead, you'll have the time of your life!
Graveney: Adultery? Pillage? Through all eternity?
Edmund: Yep!
King: (handing over a quill) Well, Graveney? Your decision...
Graveney: Very well. (signs) I leave my lands to the Crown, and my soul in the hands of the Lord. May He treat me like the piece of refuse that I am (rubs his hands together, grinning) and send me to Hell where I belong.

Blackadder: In order, ning-com-poop, that she should believe that you're her husband!
Baldrick: Why, did he used to wear a bag on his head?
Ploppy: Young Ploppy here has a point, my lord. Lord Farrow never wore a bag; he was an old-fashioned sort of a gent.
Blackadder: Look--
Percy: Well, yes, my lord. I mean, I hadn't meant to mention it, but I have been wondering all along why you should think that Baldrick with a bag on his head is going to be a dead ringer for Lord Farrow, because he's not!
Blackadder: [crossly] Look, cretins, the bag is there in order to obscure Baldrick's own features, and many might think, incidentally, that that would be reason enough for him to wear it! Before I bring in Lady Farrow, I shall explain to her, inventing some cunningly plausible excuse that her husband has taken to wearing a bag! She can then chat to Baldrick, imagining him to be the man she married, and the Queen need never know of my little miscalculation.
Ploppy: Why, my lord, that is a brilliant plan!

Percy: My Lord! Success!
Blackadder: What?
[Percy pulls him into the living room, where the table is covered with chemical apparatus]
Percy: After literally an hour's ceaseless searching, I have succeeded in creating gold! Pure gold!
Blackadder: Are you sure?
Percy: Yes, my Lord! Behold! [opens a lid on the top of the lab mess, revealing a green blob]
Blackadder: Percy, it's green.
Percy: That's right, my Lord.
Blackadder: Yes, Percy, I don't want to be pedantic or anything, but the colour of gold is gold. That's why it's called "gold". What you have discovered, if it has a name, is some "green".
Percy: [astonished, picking up the blob] Oh, Edmund! Can it be true? That I hold here, in my mortal hand, a nugget of purest green?!
Blackadder: Indeed you do, Percy. Except it's not really a nugget, is it? It's more of a splat.
Percy: Well, yes, a splat today, but tomorrow - who knows, or dares to dream?
Blackadder: [dryly] So we three alone, in all the world, can create the finest green at will?
Percy: Just so! Not sure about counting in Baldrick, actually.
Blackadder: Of course, you know what your great discovery means, don't you, Percy?
Percy: Perhaps, my Lord...
Blackadder: That you, Percy, Lord Percy, are an utter berk!

Blackadder: Baldrick!
Baldrick: My Lord?
Blackadder: Pack my bags, I'm going to sell the house.
Percy and Baldrick: What?!
Blackadder: There's nothing else for it. I mean, I shall miss the old place, I know. I've had some happy times here, when you and Percy have been out. But needs must when the devil vomits into your kettle! Baldrick, go forth into the streets and let it be known that Lord Blackadder wishes to sell his house. Percy, just go forth into the streets.

Blackadder: Now, Baldrick, go to the kitchen and make me something quick and simple to eat, would you? Two slices of bread with something in between.

[Blackadder has fallen asleep rewriting the dictionary.]
Baldick: Mr Blackadder, time to wake up.
Blackadder: What time is it?
Baldrick: Monday morning.
Blackadder: [Panicking] Monday morning? Oh my god, I've overslept! Where's the quill? Where's the parchment?
Baldrick: I dunno. Maybe Doctor Johnson has got some with him.
Blackadder: WHAT!
Baldrick: He's outside!
Blackadder: Screams in horror.
[Johnson enters.]
Johnson: Are you ill, sir?
Blackadder: No, you can't have it! I know I said Monday, but I want Baldrick to read it. Which, unfortunately, will mean teaching him to read, which will take about ten years. But time well spent, I think, because it is such a very good dictionary!
Johnson: I don't think so.
Blackadder: Oh god, we've been burgled! ... What?
Johnson: I think it's an awful dictionary full of feeble definitions and ridiculous verbiage. I've come to ask you to chuck the damned thing in the fire.
Blackadder: Are you sure?
Johnson: I've never been more sure of anything in my life, sir.
Blackadder: I love you, Doctor Johnson, and I want to have your babies. [They embrace.]

Blackadder: Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me Doctor Johnson, but my Auntie Margery's just arrived.

Blackadder: Baldrick? Who gave you permission to turn into an Alsatian? Oh god, it's a dream, isn't it? :[Johnson, Baldrick and Auntie Margery dance, a la sugar plum fairies.] It's a bloody dream! Doctor Johnson doesn't want us to burn his dictionary at all.

Blackadder: Exactly.

Mrs Miggins: Bonjour, monsieur. It's French.
Blackadder: So is eating frogs, cruelty to geese and urinating in the street. But that's no reason to inflict it on the rest of us!
Mrs Miggins: But French is all the fashion! My coffee shop is full of Frenchies, and it's all because of that wonderful Scarlet Pimpernel!
Blackadder: The Scarlet Pimpernel is not wonderful, Mrs Miggins. There is no reason whatsoever to admire someone for filling London with a bunch of garlic-chewing French toffs, crying "Oh-la-la" and looking for sympathy all the time just cos their fathers had their heads cut off! I'll have a cup of coffee, and some shepherd's pie.
Mrs Miggins: Oh, we don't serve pies any more! My French clientèle consider pies uncouth!

Blackadder: [about the Scarlet Pimpernel] What has this fellow done, apart from pop over to France to rescue a few aristocratic toffs from the ineffectual clutches of some malnourished whinging lefties, taking the opportunity while there, no doubt, to pick up some really cheap wine and some of their marvellous fruit flans?! Has everyone forgotten?! We hate the French! We fight wars against them! Did all those men die in vain on the fields of Agincourt?! Was the man who burnt Joan of Arc simply wasting good matches?!

Baldrick: [confused] What, aren't we going to France?
Blackadder: Of course we're not going to France; it's incredibly dangerous there!
Baldrick: But how are you going to win your bet?
Blackadder: As usual, Baldrick: by use of the large and wonderful thing between my ears.
Baldrick: Oh, your nose.
Blackadder: [annoyed] No, Baldrick, my brain. All we need to do is lie low here for a week, go to Mrs Miggins, pick up any French toff, drag him through a puddle, take him to the ball and collect our thousand guineas!
Baldrick: But what if the Prince finds us here?
Blackadder: He couldn't find his fly buttons, let alone the kitchen door!

First there was this unholy smell, and then this tiny, clammy, hairy creature would materialize in the bed between them. Strangely I could never see it myself.

Baldrick: What, doesn't he like it either?
Blackadder: No, no, he loves it. The problem is, he doesn't realize it's made up. Last year, when Brutus was about to kill Julius Caesar, the Prince yelled out "Look behind you, Mr. Caesar!"
Baldrick: I can't see the point in the theatre. All that sex and violence - I get enough of that at home! Except for the sex, of course.

Duke of Wellington: (cuffs him on the head) I'M A DUKE, NOT A LORD! Where were you trained, a dago dancing class?! Shall I have my people thrash him for you, Highness? (the Prince frantically signals him not to)
Blackadder: Err, no. He's new, and at the moment I'm sparing the rod.
Duke of Wellington: Ah, fatal error. Give 'em an inch, and before you know it they've got a foot; much more than that, and you won't have a leg to stand on! [sees George still standing there and clouts him] GET OUT! [wellington turns back to Blackadder] Now, to business; I am told your royal father grows ever more eccentric and at present, believes himself to be...[Wellington consults his report] "a small village in Lincolnshire, commanding spectacular views of the Nene Valley". I therefore pass my full report of the war on to you, the Prince of Wales.
Blackadder: Ah, thank you. [Blackadder opens the report. It contains a single slip of paper] "We won. Signed Wellington".

Duke of Wellington: Britain has the finest trade, the finest armies, the finest navies in the world- and what do we have for royalty? (looks contemptuously at Blackadder) A mad Kraut sausage-sucker, and a son who can't keep his own sausage to himself! The sooner you're dead, the better
Blackadder: You're very kind.
Duke of Wellington: Now! You're no doubt anxious to catch up with the latest news of the war. (taps a roll of papers he is carrying) I have here the most recent briefs from my general in the field.
Blackadder: Yes, well, if you could just pop them in the laundry-basket on the way out?... (Wellington gives him a blank look) Tea?
Duke of Wellington: Yes, immediately. (Blackadder rings for tea, Wellington sits down) Now, let's turn to the second front, my lord. (pulls out a map)
Blackadder: Ah, yes. (sits down, studies the map) Now, as I understand it, Napoleon is in North Africa; and Nelson is stationed in...?
Duke of Wellington: Alaska, Your Highness. In case 'Boney' should try to trick us by coming via the North Pole.
Blackadder: (stares at him incredulously for a moment) Yessss... well, perhaps a preferable strategem, Your Grace, might be to harry him amidships as he tries to leave the Medditeranean... uh, Trafalgar might be quite a good spot.
Duke of Wellington: (intrigued) Trafalgar, eh? Well, I'll mention it to Nelson. I must say, I'm beginning to regret the necessity of killing you, Your Highness- I'd been told by everybody that the Prince was a confounded moron!
Blackadder: Oh, no, no, no. (the door opens)
Duke of Wellington: Oh, hell and buckshot, here's that tiresome servant of yours again.(Prince George comes back in with a tea-tray, sets it directly on the map, and sits next to Blackadder)
The Prince Regent: (to Blackadder) Oh- budge up, budge up.
Duke of Wellington: (jumps up) HOW DARE YOU SIT, SIR, IN THE PRESENCE OF YOUR BETTERS! GET UP!
The Prince Regent: (stands up, chuckles) Oh, cripes, yes, I forgot-
Duke of Wellington: (cuffs him in the head) You'll speak when spoken to- unless you'd rather be flayed across a gun-carriage! WELL?! (punches Prince George in the jaw, knocking him down; Blackadder hastily stands up and helps the Prince up)
Blackadder: Sir, Sir- I fear you have been too long a soldier! We no longer treat servants that way in London society.
Duke of Wellington: Why, I hardly touched the man!
Blackadder: I think you hit him rather hard.
Duke of Wellington: Nonsense! (hits George even harder, knocking him down again) That would have been a hard hit! I just hit him like that! (hits the Prince just slightly softer as he gets up)
Blackadder: No, sir. A soft hit would be like this. (hits George lightly) Whereas you hit him like this (punches George very hard and knocks him down again)
The Prince Regent: (winded and bruised from the attacks) ...I- I wonder if I might be excused, Your Highness Your Highness?
Blackadder: Certainly. (aside, to the Prince) I'm sorry about that, sir, but one has to keep up the pretense.
The Prince Regent: Oh, quite understand! You -you carry on the good work!
Blackadder: Very well, sir. (punches and knocks him down again)
Duke of Wellington: (having taken a sip from his cup) Hang on- this is bloody coffee! I ordered tea! (storms across the room and grabs Prince George by the ear) Confounded fool, aren't you?! I'd heard everywhere that the Prince was the imbecile whereas his servant Blackadder was respected about the town! Now that I discover the truth, I am disposed to beat you to death! (puts his mouth next to George's ear and yells) TEA!! (boots George's rear end as he flees with the coffee-tray)

Blackadder:: Tell me, do you ever stop shouting at the lower orders?

Blackadder: You don't think inspired leadership and tactical ability has anything to do with it?
Duke of Wellington: (pause) NO! It's all down to shouting! BAAAH!
Blackadder: I hear that conditions in your Army are appalling.
Duke of Wellington: Well, I'm sorry, but those are my conditions, and you'll just have to accept them - until this evening, that is (grins nastily) when I shall kill you.
Blackadder: Who knows? Maybe I shall kill you.

MacAdder: I'll tell you why; it's because there's no coffee shop in England big enough for two Blackadders!

MacAdder: Aye, well enough.
Blackadder: And Morag?
MacAdder: She bides fine.
Blackadder: And how how stands that mighty army, the clan MacAdder?
MacAdder: They're both well.
Blackadder: I always thought Jamie and Angus were such fine boys.
MacAdder: Angus is a girl. [pause] So, tell me cousin, I hear you have a cunning plan.
Blackadder: I do, I do. I want you to take the place of the Prince Regent, and kill the Duke of Wellington in a duel.
MacAdder: Aye, and what's in it for me?
Blackadder: Enough cash to buy the Outer Hebrides. What do you think?
MacAdder: Fourteen shillings and sixpence? Well, it's tempting...but I've got an even better plan. Why don't I pretend to be the Duke of Wellington and kill the Prince of Wales in a duel? Then I could kill the King and be crowned with the ancient stone bonnet of MacAdder!
Mrs. Miggins: And I shall wear the granite gown and limestone bodice of MacMiggins, Queen of all the herds!
Blackadder: For God's sake, MacAdder, you are not Rob Roy! You're a top kipper salesman with a reputable firm of Aberdeen fishmongers; don't throw it all away! If you kill the Prince, they'll just send the bailiffs round and arrest you!
MacAdder: Oh blast! I forgot the bailiffs.
Blackadder: So we can return to our original plan?
MacAdder: No, I'm not interested! I'd rather go to bed with the Loch Lomond Monster...and besides, I have to be back in the office by Friday; I promised Mr. McNulty I'd shift a particularly difficult bloater for him! No, forget the whole thing, I'm off home with Miggsie!
Mrs. Miggin: Yes, yes! Show me the glen where the kipper roams free! And forget Morag forever!
MacAdder: No, never! We must do right by Morag; we must return to Scotland and you must fight her in the old Highland way...bare breasted and each carrying an eight pound baby!

Baldrick: It's part of a cunning plan, actually!
Blackadder: Of course it is.
Baldrick: You know how they say that somewhere there's a bullet with your name on it?

Baldrick: ... and the chances of there being two bullets with my name are very small indeed!
Blackadder: Yes, it's not the only thing around here that's "very small indeed". Your brain, for example. Is so minute, Baldrick, that if a hungry cannibal cracked your head open, there wouldn't be enough to cover a small water biscuit.

Melchett: Field Marshal Haig has formulated a brilliant new tactical plan to ensure final victory in the field.
Blackadder: Ah. Would this brilliant plan involve us climbing out of our trenches and walking very slowly towards the enemy?
Captain Darling: How could you possibly know that, Blackadder? It's classified information!
Blackadder: It's the same plan that we used last time and the seventeen times before that.
Melchett: Exactly! And that is what is so brilliant about it! It will catch the watchful Hun totally off guard! Doing precisely what we've done eighteen times before is exactly the last thing they'll expect us to do this time! There is, however, one small problem.
Blackadder: That everyone always gets slaughtered in the first ten seconds.
Melchett: That's right. And Field Marshal Haig is worried this may be depressing the men a tad. So he's looking for a way to cheer them up.
Blackadder: Well, his resignation and suicide seems the obvious choice.
Melchett: Hmm, interesting thought. Make a note of it, Darling.

Darling: No you couldn't. Goodbye!

George: Oh, Mr. Thicko, imagine not knowing that! [George and Blackadder were given the impression beforehand pilots only flew for twenty minutes]
Flashheart: Well it's simple! The average life expectancy of a new pilot is twenty minutes!
Darling: [gleefully] Ah. [Blackadder and George look deeply unnerved]
Blackadder: Life expectancy of twenty minutes?!
Flashheart: That's right! Goggles on, chocks away, last one back's a homo! Hurray! [Flash and the other recruits run out. Blackadder consults his watch]

Baldrick: Oh dear, Captain B., my tummy's gone all squirty!
Blackadder: That's because you're scared, Baldrick, and you're not the only one. I couldn't be more petrified if a wild rhinoceros had come home from a hard day at the swamp and found me wearing his pyjamas, smoking his cigars and in bed with his wife!
Baldrick: I've heard what these Germans'll do, sir; they'll have their wicked way with anything of woman-born!
Blackadder: Well, in that case, Baldrick, you're quite safe! However, the Teutonic reputation for brutality is well-founded: their operas last three or four days, and they have no word for "fluffy".
Baldrick: I want my mum!

Darling: [Stuttering nervously] Oh, well, it... It wasn't quite like that, sir. It's just that we... weighed up the pros and cons and... decided it wasn't a reasonable use of our time and resources. [Laughs nervously]
Flashheart: Well, this isn't a reasonable use of my time and resources, but I'm gonna do it anyway!
Darling: What?

Now if you'll excuse me, I have better things to do than exchange pleasantries with a wet blanket. Would you get out? [Mary gawps at him in astonishment] We've got some important military business.

Darling: This is completely ridiculous, Blackadder! You can't suspect me, I've only just arrived.

Blackadder: What, for obeying the General's orders? That may be what you do in Munich — or should I say München — but not here, Werner! You're a filthy Hun spy, aren't you?! Baldrick, the cocker spaniel, please.
Darling: [desperate] Ah! No, no, no, wait! No, look, I'm English! I was born in Croydon! [breathing heavily] I was educated at Ipplethorpe Primary School! I've got a girlfriend called Doris! I know the words to all three verses of "God Save the King!"

Nurse Mary: Well, he pooh-poohed the captain here and said that he'd never find the spy.
Melchett: [seriously] Is this true, Blackadder? Did Captain Darling pooh-pooh you?
Blackadder: Well, perhaps a little.
Melchett: Well then, damn it all, how much more evidence do you need? The pooh-poohing alone is a court-martial offence!
Blackadder: I can assure you, sir, that the pooh-poohing was purely circumstantial.
Melchett: Well, I hope so, Blackadder. You know, if there's one thing I've learned from being in the army, it's never ignore a pooh-pooh! I knew a major: got pooh-poohed; made the mistake of ignoring the pooh-pooh -- he pooh-poohed it! Fatal error, because it turned out all along that the soldier who pooh-poohed him had been pooh-poohing a lot of other officers, who pooh-poohed their pooh-poohs! In the end, we had to disband the regiment! Morale totally destroyed... by pooh-pooh!

We'd hammered Oxford's tiddlywinkers only the week before and there we were, off to hammer the Boche! Crushingly superb bunch of blokes. Fine, clean-limbed… even their acne had a strange nobility about it.
Blackadder: Yes, and how are all the boys now?
George: Oh, uh, well… Jocko and the Badger bought it at the first Ypres, unfortunately. Quite a shock, that. I remember Bumfluff's house-master wrote and told me that Sticky had been out for a duck, and the Gubber had snitched a parcel sausage-end and gone goose-over-stump frogside.

George: Oh... Oh no, sir! Absolutely not! [quietly to Baldrick] Mad as a bicycle!
Baldrick: I heard that it started when a bloke called Archie Duke shot an ostrich 'cause he was hungry.
Blackadder: I think you mean it started when the Archduke of Austro-Hungary got shot.
Baldrick: Nah, there was definitely an ostrich involved, sir.
Blackadder: Well, possibly. But the real reason for the whole thing was that it was too much effort not to have a war.
George: By Gum, this is interesting! I always loved history. The Battle of Hastings, Henry VIII and his six knives and all that!
Blackadder: You see, Baldrick, in order to prevent a war in Europe, two super blocs developed: us, the French and the Russians on one side; and the Germans and Austro-Hungary on the other. The idea was to have two vast, opposing armies, each acting as the other's deterrent. That way, there could never be a war.
Baldrick: Except, well, this is sort of a war, isn't it?
Blackadder: That's right. There was one tiny flaw in the plan.

Baldrick: Ah. But over here, I have one that I made earlier. [holds up a pumpkin with a face and wig] I will balance it on the King's head, like this, then I will cover his real head with a cloak. And then, when I execute him, instead of cutting off his real head, I will cut off the pumpkin and the king survives!
Blackadder: I'm not sure it's going to work, Balders.

Lord Blackadder: Ah, Melchett! Greetings! I trust Christmas brings you its traditional mix of good food and violent stomach cramp.
Lord Melchett: And compliments of the season to you, Blackadder. May the Yuletide log slip from your fire and burn your house down.
Lord Blackadder: I'm glad I saw you; I feel it only fair to warn you that the Queen has banned Christmas. So I wouldn't get her a present this year.
Lord Melchett: Oh, I'm indebted to you for that advice, Blackadder, and I shall, of course, follow it to the letter...[under his breath as he walks away] the day I get my brain replaced by a cauliflower.
Lord Blackadder: [jubilant] Ha! Got him with my subtle plan!
Baldrick: I can't see any subtle plan.
Lord Blackadder: Baldrick, you wouldn't see a subtle plan if it painted itself purple and danced naked on top of a harpsichord, singing "Subtle Plans are Here Again!"
Nursie: Pity about this, tinky-wink; you always used to love this time of year!
Queenie: I know. Leaving a little mince pie and a glass of wine out for Father Christmas, and then scoffing it, because I was a princess and could do what I bloody well liked!
Nursie: And wondering if your father's wife would last until Boxing Day without having her head cut off!
Queenie: We knew if he gave her a hat, she'd probably be alright.
Lord Blackadder: [sarcastically] Perhaps Lord Melchett would like to whip me naked through the streets of Aberdeen?
Lord Melchett: Oh I don't think we need go that far, Blackadder...
Lord Blackadder: [sarcastically] Oh too kind!
Lord Melchett: No, Aylesbury's quite far enough.
Queenie: Now Blackadder, what have you got me?
Lord Blackadder: [having destroyed her Christmas present] Um...
Queenie: I WANT A PREZZIE! Give me something nice and shiny, and if you don't, I've got something nice and shiny for you: it's called AN AXE!

Edmund Blackadder, Esq.: So, shall I begin?
The Prince Regent: Absolutely, as long as it's not that terribly depressing one about the chap who gets born on Christmas Day, shoots his mouth off about everything under the sun, and then comes a cropper with a couple of rum coves on top of a hill in Johnny Arab land!
Edmund Blackadder, Esq.: You mean, Jesus?
The Prince Regent: Yes, that's the bloke! Keep him out of it; he always spoils the Xmas atmos!
[After Blackadder discovers his plan to rob the Prince Regent of his Christmas valuable has gone badly wrong, thanks to Baldrick's stupidity]
Baldrick: Something wrong, Mr. B.?
Edmund Blackadder, Esq.: No, don't worry, I should've known not to trust a man with the mental agility of a rabbit dropping!
Baldrick: Sorry, Mr. B.
Edmund Blackadder, Esq.: Oh, it's perfectly alright, it's not your fault. [he floors Baldrick with a punch] Still, I fear for a frail, elderly woman, laden down with valuables, travelling through the inadequately lit streets of London!
Baldrick: Yeah, she's not safe!
Edmund Blackadder, Esq.: Well, not from me, certainly!
[A reformed Ebenezer Blackadder hands Baldrick the money he just lifted from his niece's fiancée.]
Blackadder: Baldrick, I want you to take this and go out and buy a turkey so large, you'd think its mother had been rogered by an omnibus. I'm going to have a party, and no one's invited but me!
[Mrs. Scratchit arrives to swindle him]
Mrs. Scratchit: Coo-eee!
Blackadder: No peace for the wicked.
Mrs. Scratchit: [soppily] Ah, Mr. Ebenezer, I was wondering if you had perhaps a little present for me? Or had found me a little fowl for Tiny Tom's Christmas?
Blackadder: I have always found you foul, Mrs. Scratchit, and more than a little. [she looks shocked] As for Tiny Tom's Christmas, he can stuff it up his enormous muscular backside.
Mrs. Scratchit: But he's a cripple!
Blackadder: He's not a cripple, Mrs. Scratchit. Occasionally saying "phew, my leg hurts" when he remembers to wouldn't fool Baldrick.
Baldrick: It did, actually.
Blackadder: However, if you want something for lunch, [picks up a pale] take this. It's a pound a lump and, as luck would have it, there are 17 lumps left. [Takes back the money she had swindled from him earlier] Thank you.
Mrs. Scratchit: But what about my Tiny Tom?
Blackadder: Well, if I was you, I'd scoop him out and use him as a houseboat. Good day.
[Mrs. Scratchit walks out, crying]
Baldrick: Mister B, where's the milk of human kindness?
Blackadder: It's gone off, Baldrick. It stinks. [the doorbell rings] Get that, and whoever it is, slam the door in their face, otherwise I'll slam your face in the door!

[Baldrick opens the door to find Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and their aide prepared to give Blackadder a reward for his generosity.]
Queen Victoria: We are Queen Victoria.
Baldrick: What, all three of you?
Queen Victoria: [laughes] My dear little hobgoblin...here is our Royal Seal [she presents it to Baldrick, who goes down on one knee]. We are here to present your master with £50,000 and the title of Baron Blackadder for being the kindest man in England!
Baldrick: Lovely, your Majesty. [Blackadder, not realising what's going on, storms over]
Blackadder: Baldrick, what did I tell you I'd do if you didn't slam the door in the faces of these scrounging loafers?!
Baldrick: But, Mr. Blackadder, it's-! [As promised, Blackadder slams the door in Baldrick's face, then slams it shut on the royals]
Blackadder: I am not at home to guests! [the royals let themselves in again]
Prince Albert: I flatter myself, we are rather special guests.
Blackadder: [not realising who they are] But of course! I must apologise; it is not often that one receives a Christmas visit from two distinguished guests!
Prince Albert: Ah, so you recognise us at last?
Blackadder: Yes, unless I'm very much mistaken, you're the winner of the "Round Britain Shortest, Fattest, Dumpiest Woman" competition! And for her to be accompanied by the winner of this year's "Stupidest Accent Award" is really quite overwhelming! [Victoria and Albert look mortified]
Queen Victoria: Sir, I cannot believe-!
Blackadder: Cork it, fatso! Don't you realise that this is the Victorian Age where, apart from Queen Piglet Features herself, [Albert covers her ears] women and children are to be seen and not heard!?
Prince Albert: [outraged] Queen Piglet Features!?
Blackadder: Yes, Empress Oink, as lads call her! The only person in the kingdom that looks dafter than her is that stupid frankfurter of a husband! [Albert covers his own ears] "The Pig and the Prig", we call them! How they ever managed to produce their 112 children is quite beyond me! The bed chambers at Buckingham Palace must be copiously supplied with blindfolds!
Queen Victoria: Sir, we have never been so insulted in our entire lives! [they storm out]
Blackadder: Well, all I can say is you've been damned lucky!

[Blackadder punches William Shakespeare.]
Blackadder: That is for every schoolboy and schoolgirl for the next 400 years! Do you have any idea how much suffering you're going to cause? Hours spent at school desks trying to find one joke in A Midsummer Night's Dream? Years spent wearing stupid tights in school plays saying things like 'what ho, my lord' and 'look, here cometh Othello talking total crap as usual'? Oh, and ... [kicks Shakespeare] That is for Ken Branagh's endless, uncut, four-hour version of Hamlet!
Shakespeare: Who's Ken Branagh?
Blackadder: I'll tell him you said that. And I think he'll be very hurt.

Blackadder: [crouched beneath Hadrian's Wall] That's odd; the machine seems to be seeking out our DNA across time!
[Atop the wall, a Roman Blackadder and Baldrick stand at attention]
Centurion Blaccadicus: Just brilliant!
Legionary Baldricus: What, O Centurion?
Centurion Blaccadicus: We're facing a horde of ginger maniacs, with wild goats nesting in their huge orange beards-or to put it another way, the Scots!-and how does our inspired leader Hadrian intend to keep out this vast army of lunatics!? By building a a three-foot high wall! [sarcastic] A terrifying obstacle! About as frightening as a little rabbit with the word "Boo!" painted on its nose! [Baldricus shudders]
Consul Georgius: Oh come now, Centurion! I won't have that! This wall is a terrific defence mechanism! Surely you're not suggesting that a rabble of Scots could get the better of Roman soldiers!?
[Further conversation is halted by the arrival of General Melchicus]
Consul Georgius: Ah, welcome General!
General Melchicus: Splendid! Good to see you practicing your English, Georgius! [continues in Latin] However, important news- Rome is being attacked on all sides, and so far the Emperor's only response has been to poison his mother and marry his horse. The Senate is therefore withdrawing troops from Britain to defend our Imperial city.
Centurion Blaccadicus: Did you hear that, Balders?
Legionary Baldricus: I certainly did, Centurion!
Centurion Blaccadicus: Back to Rome, at last!
General Melchicus: [in Latin] BAAA!
Consul Georgius: [looking beyond the wall] I say, this is interesting! There appears to be a large orange hedge moving towards us!
Centurion Blaccadicus: That's not a hedge, Consul. That's the Scots!

Blackadder: Let's get home, Baldrick.
Baldrick: [wailing] But we don't know where home is! We're doomed to float through time, for all time! OH, WOE IS ME...!!
Blackadder: [notices a button] Shut up, Baldrick, shut up. There is one final thing to push which may be our salvation! [he pushes it; nothing happens] ...Or not. [Pulls it out] Because it is, in fact, a lollipop.
Baldrick: Raspberry flavoured, my lord.
Blackadder: [sitting down] Oh God! I'm going to spend the rest of my life﻿ in a small wooden room with two toilets and the stupidest man in the world.
Baldrick: Wait, my lord, do not despair. For I have a cunning plan.
Blackadder: ...Can I say I'm not optimistic, Baldrick?
Baldrick: To be quite frank, my lord, neither am I. My family have never been very good at plans.
Blackadder: So, with suitably low expectations, what is your cunning plan to get us home?
Baldrick: Well, my lord, you know how, when people drown, their whole life flashes in front of them?
Blackadder: Yeeees?
Baldrick: Well, if you stuck your head in a bucket of water and didn't bring it out again, then your whole life would flash in front of you, and you'd see where all the knobs and levers were when first set off. And then, if you pulled your head out again, just before you died, you could guide us home!
Blackadder: [standing up] Baldrick...
Baldrick: My lord?
Blackadder: Good plan. But perhaps just one tiny modification...
Baldrick: Hmm?
[Blackadder punches Baldrick and shoves his head down a toilet]
Blackadder: [pulls Baldrick out] How's it going?
Baldrick: I'm eighteen years old, I've just left nursery school!
Blackadder: Okey-dokey! [drowns Baldrick some more, then pulls him out]
Baldrick: I'm twenty five; I'm back at nursery school!
[Sighing in annoyance, Blackadder drowns him even more; he finally sees the combination, and Blackadder pulls him out]
Baldrick: [spitting out water] GOT IT!
Blackadder: Very good.
Baldrick: [gasping] I wish... I wish I'd flushed the loo first!
Blackadder: [looking down it] Oh, yes...

Baldrick: As we approach the end, my lord, what do you think we've learned on our great journey?
Blackadder: Good question, Baldrick. I suppose I've learned that I must buy you a much stronger mouthwash for Christmas this year. How about you?
Baldrick: Oh, I dunno. I suppose I've learned that human beings have always been the same. Some nice, some nasty; some clever, some stupid; there's always a Blackadder and there's always a Baldrick.
Blackadder: Yes, very profound, Baldrick.
Baldrick: Also, it occurs to me...
Blackadder: [annoyed] Oh God, there's not more, is there?
Baldrick: ...If you're in the right place at the right time, then every person has the power to go out and change the world for the better.
Blackadder: God, you really are as thick as clotted cream, that's been left out by some clot, until the clots are so clotted up you couldn't un-clot them with an electric de-clotter... aren't you, Baldrick? Real change comes from huge socioeconomic things that individuals have no effect on.
Baldrick: Unless you're King or Prime Minister or something.
Blackadder: Well, yes, I suppose they can make a difference. But for the rest of us, all we can do in life is to try to make a bit of cash! [the machine finally arrives home] Which is what I intend to do right now.
