Jack: Nah, standard black.
Kate: I might throw up on you.
Jack: [shaking his head] You're doing fine.
Kate: You don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.
Jack: Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac. Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I … And the terror was just so … crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count: One, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.
Kate: If that had been me, I think I would have run for the door.
Jack: No, I don't think that's true. You're not running now.

Locke: We know there are wild boar on the island. w:Razorbacks by the look of em. The ones that came into the camp last night were piglets, 100, 150 pounds each. Which means that there's a mother nearby. A 250 pound rat, with scimitar like tusks, a surly disposition, who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything that comes near it. Boar's usual mode of attack is to circle around and charge from behind so I figure it'll take at least three of us to distract her long enough for me to flank one of the piglets, pin it and slit its throat.

I've been on some benders in my time, but this guy he was going for an all time record. It turns out this guy has a son his son's a doctor, too. They had some kind of big time falling out. The guy knew it was his fault even though his son was back in the States thinking the same damn thing.
Jack: [starts to recognize who Sawyer's talking about]

Locke: Yeah, tested.
Jack: I think...
Locke: That's why you and I don't see eye-to-eye sometimes, Jack -- because you're a man of science.
Jack: Yeah, and what does that make you?
Locke: Me, well, I'm a man of faith. Do you really think all this is an accident -- that we, a group of strangers survived, many of us with just superficial injuries? Do you think we crashed on this place by coincidence -- especially, this place? We were brought here for a purpose, for a reason, all of us. Each one of us was brought here for a reason.
Jack: Brought here? And who brought us here, John?
Locke: The island. The island brought us here. This is no ordinary place, you've seen that, I know you have. But the island chose you, too, Jack. It's destiny.
Jack: Did you talk with Boone about destiny, John?
Locke: Boone was a sacrifice that the island demanded. What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events that led us here -- that led us down a path -- that led you and me to this day, to right now.
Jack: And where does that path end, John?
Locke: The path ends at the hatch. The hatch, Jack -- all of it -- all of it happened so that we could open the hatch.

Ben: Your flight crashed on September 22 2004. Today is November 29. That means you've been on our island for 69 days, and, yes, we do have contact with the outside world, Jack. That's how we know that, during those 69 days, your fellow Americans re-elected George W. Bush, Christopher Reeve has passed away. Boston Red Sox won the World Series.

Ben: What?
Jack: [still laughing] If you wanted me to believe this, you probably should've picked somebody else, besides the Red Sox.
Ben: No, they were down, three games to none, against the Yankees in the league championship, and then they won eight straight.
Jack: Sure, sure, of course they did.

Ben: I was born on this island; not many of my people can say that. Most of them were recruited and brought here, and as much as they love this place, as much as they would do anything to defend it, they need to know that they can leave if they want to. The sub maintains that illusion.
Locke: So you're lying to them?
Ben: No... they're here because they want to be here. Some of them are just not ready to make a full commitment yet. But you John, you've already made that commitment. And now you have a choice, because if you stop and think, I can show you things. things I know that you want to see very badly. Let me put it so you'll understand: picture a box. You know something about boxes, don't you John? What if I told you that somewhere on this island there is a very large box and whatever you imagined, whatever you wanted to be in it, when you open that box, there it would be. What would you say about that John?
Locke: I'd say that I hope that box is big enough for you to imagine up a new submarine.
Ben: Why are you so angry John?
Locke: Because you're cheating. You communicate with the outside world whenever you want to, you come and go as you please, you use electricity and running water and guns. You're a hypocrite. You don't deserve to be on this island. If you had any idea what this place was you wouldn't be putting chicken in your refrigerator.
Ben: You have been on this island for 80 days, John. I have been here my entire life. So what makes you think you know this island better than I do?
Locke: Because you're in the wheelchair, and I'm not.

Juliet: You're gonna. Right now, it feels like there's broken glass under my skin. And if it weren't for you, I would be on my way home right now.
Kate: Jack told me not to come back to protect me! Because he didn't want me to get hurt!
Juliet: Is that what you think?
Kate: Yeah, that's what I think!
Juliet: We have cameras on the cages, Kate. All of them. He saw you. You and Sawyer. The reason Jack told you not to come back wasn't because he didn't want you to get hurt. It was because you broke his heart. So. Grab my wrist. Push up. And twist!

Ben:[Hands Locke a knife] I know it won't be easy. But the quicker the better.
Cooper:[After Ben ungags him] You're kidding me, right? You expect him to kill me?
Ben: John, the hesitation you're feeling is just the part of you that still feels that he has a perfectly good explanation for stealing your kidney. Throwing you out of an eight-story window. Don't you wanna be free from him?
Cooper: The hesitation he's feeling is because he is a spineless--
Locke:[Growing anxious] Shut up! I, I've gotta think...
Ben: Don't think, John.
Cooper: You're wasting your time, bug-eye. Me and him have been through all of this. All he wants is his daddy.
Locke: Shut up! I SAID SHUT UP!
Ben: Let go of him, John.
Locke: Why are you doing this to me?
Ben: You're doing this to yourself. As long as he's still breathing, you will still be that same sad, pathetic little man who was kicked off of his walkabout tour because you couldn't walk!

Cooper: It means that bald headed bastard outside the door is my son.
Sawyer: Come again?
Cooper: My son. As in I'm his father. You do speak English?
Sawyer: How did you get here, to the Island?
Cooper: Island? OK. I'm driving down I10 through Tallahassee when bam, somebody slams into the back of my car. I go right into the divider at seventy miles an hour, the next thing I know, the paramedics are strapping me to a gurney, stuffing me into the back of an ambulance and one of them actually smiles at me as he pops the IV in my arm. And then, nothing. Just, black. And the next thing I know I wake up in a dark room tied up, gag in my mouth, and when the door opens, I'm looking up at the same man I threw out a window, John Locke. My dead son.
Sawyer: And he's dead cause you threw him out a window?
Cooper: No he survived that. But it paralysed him, permanently. He's dead because the plane he was flying on crashed in the Pacific.
Sawyer: Well I got bad news for ya pops, cause I was on that plane with your son. He sure as hell wasn't crippled. And we didn't crash in the Pacific, we crashed here on this Island.
Cooper: You sure its an Island?
Sawyer: Well what else is it?
Cooper: Little hot for heaven isn't it?
Sawyer: [Sarcastically] Oh OK, so we're dead?
Cooper: They found your plane on the bottom of the ocean. One minute I'm in a car wreck and the next minute I'm in a pirate ship in the middle of the jungle. If this isn't hell friend, then where are we?
Sawyer: Why did you throw Locke out a window?
Cooper: He was becoming a nuisance. I conned him into giving me one of his kidneys. He never got over it.
Sawyer: [Pauses] Conned?
Cooper: Yes sir, conned.
Sawyer: What's your name?
Cooper: Hmm?
Sawyer: Your name.
Cooper: A conman goes by many names friend. I've been Alan Seward, Anthony Cooper, Ted MacLaren, Tom Sawyer, Louis Jackson, and Paul...

You had sex with my mother, and then you stole my dad's money all away, so he got angry and he killed my mother, and then he killed himself” blah blah blah blah. So what? Is this supposed to be you, you wrote this letter? Hey wait a second. Did you take my name because you were on some kind of revenge kick?
Sawyer: Keep reading.
Cooper: Easy, easy, don't get all worked up. Look, I ran that con two dozen times. If your mother was one of the...
Sawyer: Mary. Her name was Mary.
Cooper: Mary from Jasper, Alabama. Yeah, I remember her. She practically begged me to take her thirty-eight thousand dollars and to rescue her from her sorry little life.
Sawyer: You finish the letter.
Cooper: Look, I only took her money. It ain't my fault your dad overreacted. If he pulled the old murder suicide then I'm sure he's down here somewhere. Er, maybe you could take this up with him...
Sawyer: FINISH IT!!!
Cooper: OK. OK.

Ben: This is where I came from, John. These are my people. The DHARMA Initiative. They came here seeking harmony, but they couldn't even coexist with the Island's original inhabitants. And when it became clear that one side had to go, one side had to be purged, I did what I had to do. I was one of the people that was smart enough to make sure that I didn't end up in that ditch, which makes me considerably smarter than you, John.

But hiding's pointless; they're just going to keep coming back, so I went out and I found some help. And for the past few days, she's been bringing dynamite back from the Black Rock. For the very first time, we know exactly what they want, when they're coming to get it and they have no idea. We're going to be waiting for them. So Juliet's going to mark the tents with the white rocks just like she was told to, but there's not going to be any pregnant women inside; there's going to be plenty of what we just used on that tree. So tomorrow night, we stop hiding, we stop running, we stop living in fear of them, because when they show up, we're going to blow them all to hell.

Daniel Faraday: I think Eloise's brain short-circuited. The jumps between the present and the future eventually, she eventually, she couldn't tell which was which. She had no anchor.
Desmond: What do you mean, "anchor"?
Daniel Faraday: Something familiar in both times. All this, see all this is all variables. It's random; it's chaotic. Every equation needs stability, something known. It's called a "constant." Desmond, you have no constant. When you go to the future nothing there is familiar. So if you want to stop this, then you need to find something there, something that you really, really care about, something that also exists back here in 1996.
Desmond: This constant, can it be a person?
Daniel Faraday: Yeah, maybe. But you have to make contact. Didn't you say you were out on a boat in the middle of nowhere? [Desmond picks up a phone and begins dialing] Uh, who are you calling?

Sawyer: It was. Blown up, just like we left it.
Dan: Okay. So when we are now... It's now after you and your people crashed on the island.
Sawyer: You sayin' our camp is back on the beach again?
Dan: It's possible, yeah.
Sawyer: Good. I'm going back.
Dan: Hey. No, no. (stoping him) It's pointless.
Sawyer: More pointless than staring at a hole in the ground?
Dan: We don't know when the next flash is coming. By the time you get back to the beach, the camp could be gone again.
Sawyer: Yeah. But what if it ain't? Hell, what if the helicopter hasn't even taken off yet?
Juliet: We could warn them. Stop them from ever flying to that boat.
Dan: That is not the way it works.
Sawyer: Who says?
Dan: You cannot change anything. You can't. Even if you tried to, it wouldn't work.

Locke: Jack, Kate? But the chopper was headed for the boat. The boat...

Hurley: Okay. See, we did crash, but it was on this crazy island. And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue. And there was a smoke monster, and then there were other people on the island. We called them the Others, and they started attacking us. And we found some hatches, and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or... well, I was never really clear on that. But... the Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches. That was the DHARMA Initiative. The Others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us. And then we teamed up with the Others because some worse people were coming on a freighter. Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us. So we stole their helicopter and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up. And we couldn't go back to the island because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean, and we floated there for a while until a boat came and picked us up. And by then, there were six of us. That part was true. But the rest of the people... who were on the plane? They're still on that island.

I'm sure that doesn't mean that much to you, 'cause back when you were calling the shots, you pretty much just reacted. See, you didn't think, Jack, and as I recall, a lot of people ended up dead.
Jack: I got us off the island.
Sawyer: But here you are... Right back where you started. So I'm gonna go back to reading my book, and I'm gonna think 'cause that's how I saved your ass today. And that's how I'm gonna save Sayid's tomorrow. All you gotta do is go home, get a good night's rest. I do what I do

The Man in Black: I'm not talking about Jacob. I'm talking about John Locke. Do you want to know what he was thinking while you choked the life out of him, Benjamin? What the last thought that ran through his head was? "I don't understand." Isn't that just the saddest thing you've ever heard? But it's fitting in a way because when John first came to the island, he was a very sad man. A victim shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do, even though they were right. He was weak and pathetic, and irreparably broken, but despite all of that, there was something admirable about him. He was the only one of them who didn't want to leave. The only one who realized how pitiful the life he left behind actually was.

Locke: My walkabout. An adventure in the outback. Man against nature. But they wouldn't let me go. And I sat there yelling at them. Shouting at them that they couldn't tell me what I can't do. But they were right. I'm sick of imagining of what my life could be out of this chair, Helen. What it would be like to walk down the aisle with you because its not gonna happen. So if you need me to see more doctors, have more consults, if you need me to get out of this chair, I don't blame you.

Sawyer: Thanks but I've been to the Temple already. I'm sticking with Locke.
Richard: No, the man you are with is not John Locke.
Sawyer: I know.
Richard: Than why are you with him?
Sawyer: 'Cause he's got answers. He knows why I'm on the Island. Unless you wanna tell me why I'm here, Richard!
Richard: Don't be naive. He's not gonna tell you anything, he's gonna kill you.
Sawyer: If he wanted to kill me he could've done it a dozen times by now.

The Man in Black: Doesn't everybody?
Sawyer: You ever read Of Mice and Men. Steinbeck, it's my favorite.
The Man in Black: No, a little after my time.
Sawyer: It's about these two guys, George and Lenny. Lenny's kinda slow... causin' George problems... so George walks him into the woods and tells him to look out yonder and picture the pretty little house they're gonna live in some day. Then he shoots Lenny in the back of the head.
The Man in Black: That doesn't sound like a very happy ending.

Sawyer: I'm wondering what would happen if I was to put a bullet in your head?
The Man in Black: Let's find out?
Sawyer:[Sawyer hesitates and lowers the gun] What are you?
The Man in Black: What I am is trapped. And I've been trapped for so long that I don't even remember what it feels like to be free. Maybe you can understand that. But before I was trapped, I was a man, James. Just like you.
Sawyer: I'm havin' a hard time believin' that...
The Man in Black: You can believe whatever you want, that's the truth. I know what it's like to feel joy... to feel pain, anger, fear... to experience betrayal. I know what it's like to lose someone you love. So if you wanna shoot me, shoot me. But you're so close, James. It would be such a shame to turn back now.

Sawyer: Protect it from what?
The Man in Black: From nothing, James. That's the real joke; there is nothing to protect it from. It's just a damn island! And it will be perfectly fine without you or me or anyone else whose lives Jacob wasted.

The Man in Black: Leave! But because Jacob chose you you were trapped on this Island, before you even got here. Now Jacob's dead, we don't need to be trapped here. We can get on a plane and fly away anytime we want.
Jack: If we could just get on a plane and fly away, why would you even still be here?
The Man in Black: Because it has to be all of us.
[Jack still looks uncertain]
The Man in Black: What?
Jack: John Locke was the only one of us who ever believed in this place. He did everything he could to keep us from leaving this Island.
The Man in Black: John Locke was not a believer, Jack. He was a sucker.

The Man in Black: Why?
Claire:[Looking at Jack] Because he's my brother.

Jack: Claire, I'm-- I'm sorry we--
Claire: Did he tell you? That he was the one pretending to be our father?
Jack: Yeah, he did.
Claire: You know I pretty much gave up hoping that any of you would come back. And now that you're here...it's good to see you, Jack.
Jack: Yeah, it's good to see you too.
Claire: Well, I've never had much in the way of family so it really means a lot that you're coming with us.
Jack: Actually, I haven't decided if I'm coming with you.
Claire: Yeah you have.
Jack: What do you mean?
Claire: You decided the moment you let him talk to you, just like the rest of us. So, whether you like it or not, you're with him now.

Jack: Leaving The Island.
Sawyer: Wanna me why not?
Jack: Because I remember how I felt the last time I left. Like a part of me was missing.
Sawyer: They got pills for that, doc.
Jack: We were brought here because we were supposed to do something, James. And if Locke-- if that thing wants us to leave, maybe it's because he's afraid of what happens if we stay.
Sawyer: Get off my damn boat.
Jack: What?
Sawyer: You got a choice to make and you make it now. Either you're with you and you keep that damn crazy talk to yourself or you're going in the water.
Jack: James this is a mistake, and I know there's a part of you that feels that. The Island isn't done with us.

Jack: No he's not! Locke can't kill us.
Hurley: Uhh, what?
Jack: This is what he wanted. This has been what he has been waiting for. Everything that he has done has been to get us here. He wanted to get us all at the same place at the same time in a nice enclosed space where we had no hopes of getting out.
Jin: I don't understand.
Jack: Locke said that he couldn't leave the Island without us. I think that he can't leave the Island unless we're all dead. He told me that he could kill any one of us whenever he wanted, so what if he hasn't because he's not allowed to? What if he's trying to get us to kill each other?
Sawyer: Stay out of my way Doc.
Jack: If he wanted that thing to blow up, why did he put a timer on it? Why not just throw it inside?

Man In Black: [sheaths his dagger] Yes…How are you?
Mother: I’m worried.
Man In Black: Well, Mother, you should be. I spent 30 years searching for that place you brought me as a child--that…waterfall with that beautiful light. I’ve walked this island from end to end, not once coming close to finding it. But, then I began to think--what if the light underneath the island--what if I could get to it from someplace else? Figuring out how to reach it took a very long time.
Mother: The people with you, they saw this, too?
Man In Black: Yes, they have some very interesting ideas about what to do with it.
Mother: Do with it? You don’t’ have any idea wh--
Man In Black: I have no idea because you wouldn’t tell me, Mother.

Mother: What is that?
Man In Black: It’s a wheel…We’re going to make an opening…one much bigger than this one; and, then I’m going to attach that wheel to a system we’re building. A system that channels the water and the light. And then I’m gonna turn it. And when I do…I’ll finally be able to leave this place.

Mother: It would be worse than dying, Jacob. Much worse. [She pulls out a jug of wine and pours some into a cup. She whispers a Latin incantation over it] Here, drink this.

Widmore: Why would you do that?
The Man in Black: You told her not to talk to me. That made her pointless. Now... Charles, it's clear you're not afraid to die. So there's only one way to motivate you to tell me what I want to know. Soon this will all be over. I'll get what I want. And I'll finally leave this Island. And when I do, the first thing I'm gonna do is kill your daughter. Penny.

[The group gathers around] I don't really know where to start.
Hurley: How about why you brought us to the Island.
Jacob: I brought all of you here because I made a mistake. A mistake I made a very long time ago, and now, because of that there's a very good chance every single one of you and everyone you've ever cared about is going to die.
Sawyer: What mistake?
Jacob: You call him "The Monster." But I'm responsible for what happened to him. I made him that way. And ever since then he's been trying to kill me. It was only a matter of time before he figured out how, and when he did, someone would have to replace me. And that's why I brought you all here.
Sawyer: Tell me something, Jacob. Why do I gotta be punished for your mistake? What made you think you could mess with my life? I was doing just fine until you dragged my ass to this rock.
Jacob: No you weren't. None of you were. I didn't pluck any of you out of some happy existence. You were all flawed. I chose you because you were all like me. You were all alone. You were all looking for something you couldn't find out there. I chose you because you needed this place as much as it needed you.
Kate: Why did you cross my name off of your wall?
Jacob: Because you became a mother. It's just a line of chalk in a cave. The job is yours if you want it, Kate.
Jack: What is the job?
Jacob: There's a light at the center of this Island. You have to make sure it never goes out. That's how you protect it.
Sawyer: Your monster friend said there's nothing to protect it from.
Jacob: You have to protect it from him. You must do what I couldn't. What I wasn't able to do.

Christian: Everyone dies sometime, kiddo. Some before you, some long after you.
Jack: Are they all here now?
Christian: Well, there is no NOW here.
Jack: Where are we, dad?
Christian: This is the place that you all made together so that you could find one another. The most important part of your life was the time that you spent with these people. That's why all of you are here. Nobody does it alone, Jack. You needed all of them and they needed you.

Christian: Not leaving, no. Moving on.
Jack: Where are we going?
Christian: Let's go find out.
