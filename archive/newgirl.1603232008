And you're like, "What is your problem? Call the police." And she's like, "Okay," but it's too late, because she's already getting murdered. Well, uh, my story's kind of like that.

Jess: It wasn't. It was me, having sex. I left my body, went up to heaven, saw my grandparents, thought it was weird that I saw my grandparents, came back down, I became a werewolf, I scared some teenagers. I came back into my body. Only thing is, he thinks my name is Katie. And that I'm a dancer and/or something involving puppets.

Jess: Andy and I have been sending each other some pretty dirty texts.
Cece: Come to the professor. Let me see.
Jess: He says, "Can't stop thinking about what you're gonna wear tonight." How do I respond?
Cece: With a simple... "Or not wear."
Jess: Okay.
Cece: Okay?
Jess: "Or not wear because sex happens naked." Send.
Cece: Okay, let me help you with that. "Just kidding. Get ready for a night you will never forget." Okay?
Jess: "Because once you see my body, you will go brain-dead and have memory loss." Send. Oh, no! Autocorrect changed "body" to "meat bar."

Jess: I need your help. I don't know what to do. I'm terrible at casual sex. I left him in there with crayons and paper, like he's a kid in a restaurant, and I told him I had to check my fantasy football.
Nick: You don't even know what that is.
Jess: No, sir, I do not know what that is. I panicked. Help me.
Nick: Look, you can't separate your feelings from sex? So what? You're a girl.
Jess: I deserve to have a shorty on the side.
Nick: Okay, a shorty is not... That's the wrong use of "shorty."

Schmidt: [about the new hipster neighbors] They hate me, and I know why they hate me, too. It's because I'm old, and they're the future of humanity: a panethnic, pansexual hivemind, and they want nothing to do with me.
Jess: They're not that great, Schmidt. Last night, Chaz and Sutton got in a fight.
Schmidt: A lovers' quarrel?
Jess: Sutton and Chaz are not a couple.
Nick: Chaz is with Fife; Brorie's with, uh... the other broad.
Jess: Actually, Brorie, Sutton and Fife are in a triad, and Chaz is a floater.

Jess: Don't call me a ninny, I'm PMSing!
Nick: Ah! Why would you... Yucky!
Schmidt: No, no, no. I don't wanna hear it.
Jess: It hurts, I feel like I've laid a million eggs and they're all hatching. I feel like I wanna murder someone, and also I want soft pretzels.
Winston: You know what? I feel the same way.
Jess: Shut up! Shut up, you! 'Cause I don't wanna hear it! I've had it! If any of you cross me, I'm gonna kick the testicles clean off your body! Clean off! You'll look like Ken dolls down there!

Nick: I'm not doing a parent trap.
Jess: Nick, they got married too young, they got divorced too young. I think this could really make them happy. They need us. Here's the plan: we're gonna make my mom look so hot that my dad can't resist her.
Nick: Your parent trap—there's no identical twins or mistaken identity. Not a parent trap, it's a makeover.
Jess: The only thing you have to do is distract my dad.
Nick: A parent trap takes weeks of scheduling. I feel like you're just throwing this together. This is a makeshift parent trap; they don't work.
Jess: Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?
Nick: I don't know, I've got something bad inside of me. I ruin things. [small pause] Let's do this parent trap.
