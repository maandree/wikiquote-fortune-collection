Alonzo: [nods] Mmm-hmm.
Crystal: Get me an Asian kid. Oh! And I'm gonna need some kind of a trophy. Have the Asian child hand me some kind of a trophy! [claps]

[Ben walks into his office and finds Alice waiting for him]
Alice: There you are. Hey, I'm having a little....
Ben: [cuts her off] I can't pretend to listen to your problems right now, we have to talk about me!
Alice: What's wrong??
Ben: I'll tell you what's wrong! Something's happening to me! Roman, is very sad about his mother, and that makes me sad. Crystal, is very very upset about a little blue person, and that makes me upset. It's just occurring to me now, I'm actually curious, how your night went with Alonzo! What the hell's happening to me?
Alice: You're becoming an actual human being.
Ben: Well I don't like it! (storms out in a huff)

Roman: Hey, how do you just talk to a woman like that?
Ben: Well first of all, it helps to use actual words.
Roman: Yeah, I wish I could tell Heather how I feel. I just get so scared.
Ben: That's a healthy fear Roman, she's tried to kill people.
Roman: [giggles] She's layered. She is just so layered!
