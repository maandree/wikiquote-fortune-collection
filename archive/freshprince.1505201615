Will: I wonder why they called her that.
Philip: For some reason, she took a liking to me. So she invited me to come with her and her sister to her dressing room for drinks.
Will: You the man, Uncle Phil.
Philip: Anyway, one thing led to another and before you know it, this old country boy...(Vivian slams a plate of food on the table in front of him) finished his Yoo-Hoo and went right home.
