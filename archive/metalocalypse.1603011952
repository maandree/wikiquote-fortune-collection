Dr. Gibbons: William Murderface's charts indicate a deep-seated rage which is split off and repressed at its core. His self-loathing is expressed most publicly and unequivocally through bodily mutilation, tattooing, alcohol abuse, and coprophilia. He blames others for his anger. He misplaces his rage and its roots. He seeks punishment, castigation, and excommunication. This self-destruction is the only way to validate powerful voices he internalized as a child. This, combined with his immense wealth and popularity, should make for a monumentally horrific birthday.

Senator Stampingston: It seems that Dethklok has decided to become professional actors. Gentlemen, our resident acting expert, Dr. Chaz Fazzledoctinhoffer. Dr. Chaz.
Dr. Chaz Fazzeldoctinhoffer: This whole Dethklok acting business concerns me! We've gone to great lengths to control movies and blend them together with television into one bland, lifeless face that the humanoid public can nourish off of.
General Crozier: You think Dethklok could really have an impact on the movie industry?
Dr. Chaz Fazzeldoctinhoffer: What Dethklok does for the news awakens the imagination of the public! They have... charisma... They have... it! They have... zazz...
General Crozier: Supposing they do make a successful movie, what's the worst case scenario?
Dr. Chaz Fazzeldoctinhoffer: Independent thought return, creative control goes back to the artists, actors become smart and cool again, movies become thoughtful, endings become hard to figure out, people go to theaters and... interact with each other...
Senator Stampingston: And become entirely harder to control...
General Crozier: The domino effect...

A double is like having a child and watching him grow up and feeling that feeling of pride and unyielding trust that no one else can ever give you.

Dr. Gibbons: Gentlemen, the ego of the bass player is fragile. His emotional insecurity is triggered by the perception that he is unloved, inadequate, and worthless. Just look at William Murderface. Frightened, scared, hate-filled—the perfect specimen of devolution—cro-magnon brow, distended jaw, clammy hands, buckled stomach, back pimplage, hitchhiker thumbs, hammer-assed, fallen arches, chicken-plucked legs, sandpapery, eczema-styled skin, dry, unkempt triangle hair. This creature...devolved...whirling in that mess of self-hatred bubbling inside. This pathetic insecurity will cause him to want to be in control, of course this will be overridden by his dominant laziness, lack of concentration, and possible bipolar disorder, which should make for a most disastrous NASCAR-type theatrical hybrid event.

Facebones: Hey folks, it's me. Facebones!
Klokateer: All right! Facebones! [another Klokateer shocks him]
Facebones: I'm here to talk about a very serious issue! Sexual harassment in the workplace! But first, what is sexual harassment? Well, sexual harassment is the act of degrading people, with your sexuality. It takes the power away from the people being harassed, and makes the harasser, more powerful than ever!
Murderface: I got fucking peppersprayed. How-how does that give me power?
Facebones: Compliments in the workplace can easily become as construtant as flirtation. Now, a short example. In this example, a Klokateer will be equipped with a shocking mechanism, that will help guide him into behaving properly at work!
Male Klokateer: Is that a new belt?
Female Klokateer: Yes, it is.
Male Klokateer: It looks very good. [gets shocked] AHHH!!!
Facebones: Saying that your belt looks good can be taken as a sexual offense. Let's try that again!
Male Klokateer: Is that a new belt?
Female Klokateer: Yes.
Male Klokateer: That is good information to have. [red light goes off with an alarm]
Facebones: Saying something like, "that is good information to have" could be kind of creepy. And they could think that he's compiling information for a parking lot attack, or a home invasion. And thaaat's harassment!
Male Klokateer: AHHHHHHHH, FUUUUCK!
Facebones: Cursing in the workplace can also make people feel awkward. Now let's try that again.
Male Klokateer: Is that a new belt?
Female Klokateer: Yes, it is.
Male Klokateer: [gets shocked right away] AHHHHHHH!
Facebones: Best to avoid all those compliments and continue working! Now let's watch that again without all those confusing compliments!
Facebones: Well done! But what if our klokateer didn't want to make any complimants, but instead, a fun joke?
Voice: NO JOKING IN THE WORKPLACE! NO JOKING IN THE WORKPLACE!
Facebones: Humor is hurtful and can ruin lives. We're almost done folks. We're rounding the corner to finish our sexual harassment fun marathon! And also practical information! Do not linger around in restrooms. Keep your office door open so the people can see that you're clearly not jacking off in there. If you get a boner during work, best excuse yourself and go home! Here's a list of t hings to remember to avoid being caught in a tricky sexual harassment lawsuit. HERE WE GO! [speaking fast] Err on the side of caution do not tell people they look good do not compare people to each other dress conservatively do not make fun of people resist the urge to be friendly this could be taken as flirting if you do happen to accidentally flirt do not make up for it by being overly friendly this could be taken as an aggressive attack.
