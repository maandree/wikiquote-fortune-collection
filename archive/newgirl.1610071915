Jess: So, you know in horror movies when the girl's like, "Oh, my God. There's something in the basement. Let me just run down there in my underwear and see what's going on, in the dark." And you're like, "What is your problem? Call the police." And she's like, "Okay," but it's too late, because she's already getting murdered. Well, uh, my story's kind of like that.

Schmidt: [about Cece] She's never gonna be happy with somebody like me, Jess.
Jess: What? That's crazy.
Schmidt: That's why I'm gonna have to White Fang her.
Jess: Schmidt, come on! Look, I try not to judge what you guys do, but please don't tell me things like that.
Schmidt: No, no, Jess, Jess. The book: White Fang.

Jess: I thought we talked about you not wearing your shower diaper in the kitchen.
Schmidt: Excuse me, do you think this has been easy for me—to wash myself all summer long with a penis cast on? Thank God this thing comes off this afternoon. And by the way, I know what you've been thinking, and the answer is yes, I have been able to reach completion with some very precise and vigorous nipple play.
Jess: Nipple play—off-limits.

Nick: You can't be a shot girl.
Jess: Why not?
Nick: Because you don't have that specific hotness that shames men into spending $9 on a $2 shot. She doesn't have it.
Jess: Are you saying I'm not hot?
Nick: No, no, no, I'm not... No, no, you're hot, you're hot.
Jess: Nick!
Nick: I'm saying you're the nurse that I wanna wake up to after having my stomach pumped. You know what I mean? It's a different kind of hot—still hot.

Jess: I had the best sex of my life last night. He brewed me like a fine chamomile.
Nick: Oh, so that was you. I thought that was a couple bums fighting.
Jess: It wasn't. It was me, having sex. I left my body, went up to heaven, saw my grandparents, thought it was weird that I saw my grandparents, came back down, I became a werewolf, I scared some teenagers. I came back into my body. Only thing is, he thinks my name is Katie. And that I'm a dancer and/or something involving puppets.

Jess: Andy and I have been sending each other some pretty dirty texts.
Cece: Come to the professor. Let me see.
Jess: He says, "Can't stop thinking about what you're gonna wear tonight." How do I respond?
Cece: With a simple... "Or not wear."
Jess: Okay.
Cece: Okay?
Jess: "Or not wear because sex happens naked." Send.
Cece: Okay, let me help you with that. "Just kidding. Get ready for a night you will never forget." Okay?
Jess: "Because once you see my body, you will go brain-dead and have memory loss." Send. Oh, no! Autocorrect changed "body" to "meat bar."

Jess: I need your help. I don't know what to do. I'm terrible at casual sex. I left him in there with crayons and paper, like he's a kid in a restaurant, and I told him I had to check my fantasy football.
Nick: You don't even know what that is.
Jess: No, sir, I do not know what that is. I panicked. Help me.
Nick: Look, you can't separate your feelings from sex? So what? You're a girl.
Jess: I deserve to have a shorty on the side.
Nick: Okay, a shorty is not... That's the wrong use of "shorty."

Nick: Urkel, Jess?
Jess: It's funny.
Nick: Okay, look, it is perfectly fine to watch TV all day.

Schmidt: [about the new hipster neighbors] They hate me, and I know why they hate me, too. It's because I'm old, and they're the future of humanity: a panethnic, pansexual hivemind, and they want nothing to do with me.
Jess: They're not that great, Schmidt. Last night, Chaz and Sutton got in a fight.
Schmidt: A lovers' quarrel?
Jess: Sutton and Chaz are not a couple.
Nick: Chaz is with Fife; Brorie's with, uh... the other broad.
Jess: Actually, Brorie, Sutton and Fife are in a triad, and Chaz is a floater.

Nick: Ah! Why would you... Yucky!
Schmidt: No, no, no. I don't wanna hear it.
Jess: It hurts, I feel like I've laid a million eggs and they're all hatching. I feel like I wanna murder someone, and also I want soft pretzels.
Winston: You know what? I feel the same way.

Nick: Your parent trap—there's no identical twins or mistaken identity. Not a parent trap, it's a makeover.
Jess: The only thing you have to do is distract my dad.
Nick: A parent trap takes weeks of scheduling. I feel like you're just throwing this together. This is a makeshift parent trap; they don't work.
Jess: Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?
Nick: I don't know, I've got something bad inside of me. I ruin things. [small pause] Let's do this parent trap.
(Jess and Cece are doing a makeover on Jess's mom)
Jess's mom: Just explain to me again why we're doing this.
Jess: Because, when Cece is all washed up as a model, she wants to be a makeup artist and I wanna help her realize her dream
(Cece looks at Jess madly and Jess says"sorry")
Cece: Yeah, that's my plan B.
Jess's mom: Ok, stop. Seriously, it's just too much! The makeup and your dress! The only reason I ware makeup in Portland, it's to keep the rain off of my face.
Jess: So your hair just does this one thing, right? Sorry!
