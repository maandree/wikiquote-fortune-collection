Do you want more? 'Cause... gets kind of boring.

Gwen: But they're not?
Jack: No. Think dangerous. Think something you can only half-see, like a glimpse, like something out of the corner of your eye.

Alice: Don't worry about that, you give me enough. [pause] Kind of easy writing cheques, huh?
Jack: Alice, you're the one who asked me to stay away. I'd come round here every week if you wanted me to, every day.
Alice: Yeah... I just can't stand it, Dad. I look older than you do, and that's never going to stop. I get older and older, and you stay the same. One day, you're going to be standing at my funeral - Looking just like you did standing at Mum's. No wonder she was so furious; you make us feel old.

Jack: Yeah. I hurt my arm.
Esther: Considering what we just went through, I would say that was a miracle.
Jack: Yeah, another one. The Torchwood Institute was set up by the British Royal Family in 1879 to defend the realm of Great Britain by investigating the unusual, the strange. And the alien.
Esther: I'm kind of guessing alien doesn't mean foreign.
Jack: Alien. As in extraterrestrial.

Oswald: How much do you know about our masters at Phicorp? Because I did a little searching of my own last night. It's been a long long time since I was allowed online, so...I tried to find out who's above Phicorp. Who owns them. But the strangest thing happened. The information just scattered away. All sorts of names and tangents and diversions, but nothing tangible. And that's when I recognized the pattern. Because I've had a lot of experience perfecting how to hide myself online. And suddenly, I'm looking at someone else doing the same. But on a massive scale. Worldwide. I wonder why.

The Cousin: Mrs. Monroe. We'd like to apologize. We're really very sorry about this. Indeed we'd like to imagine if time and tides had flown in a different way, we could have almost been friends. I hope that's some consolation. At the end. Truth of it is, we liked your message, Mrs. Monroe. We liked your style. But we already have Oswald Danes. We don't need another. And certain aspects of your strategy were revealing our hand just a little too soon. And we have been planning this so carefully for such a long time. Because we are everywhere. We are always. We are no one. And soon, the families will rise.

Gwen: So listen, Category One is bad, yes?
Vera: Yeah. That's people with no brain function or anyone who would normally have died. They're now officially Category One.
Jack: Ordinary people are Category Three.
Vera: Right. That's people with no injuries, nothing. They're fine. Then Category Two is everyone in-between. People who are alive and functioning with an illness or injury that's gonna persist, but not kill.
Rex: Like me.
Vera: Yes, like you.
Rex: Wait a minute. When I got hurt, I should have died. I was Category One. But now I'm healing, so I'm Category Two. So which one am I?
Vera: Well, that's the point. People don't fit categories.
Jack: Worse than that, this process has given the United Nations a definition for life which is therefore a definition of death. The government now has the power to decide whether you're dead or alive. No one should have that much control.

Oswald: The truth is I know what I am. I know what you are too. Yes, I do. Each and every one of you. Because I know for certain what has happened to the human race. I know, because this has happened before. Fifty thousand years BC. What's called the great leap forward. Human beings suddenly, we started to bury our dead. We created art and money. And love. They loved. They learned to love. We made a leap from animal to human. And now, right now, in our very own lifetimes it has happened again. The next great leap. We have made it from animal to human to what? This is the question. After Miracle Day, what are we now? I know. This is something I know. Because I am the man who has lost Heaven forever. So I can feel the truth of it. I'm telling you, man has risen again! Now, he has a new name. And his name is Angel. Angel. Angel. We are angels. We have been helped. We have been purified. We have been given life unending. We are the first angels on Earth. And I promise you this, there are even those who have been planning for this. The agents of angels in this brand new world.

Jack: The truth.
Stewart: About what?
Jack: The Miracle. How was it done? Why was it done? How can it be undone?
Stewart: Why would I have the answer?
Jack: When the day came, PhiCorp was ready. We found warehouses stocked with painkillers waiting for the Miracle to come along.
Stewart: That's your smoking gun?
Jack: You're a man in charge. You knew it was coming.
Stewart: Mister...?
Jack: Harkness. Captain Jack Harkness.
Stewart: Are you with the military?
Jack: Freelance. I represent the people who are trying to stop PhiCorp.
Stewart: So that security breach on the thirty third floor?
Jack: That was us.
Stewart: It's not me you're after. In fact I've been trying to find out the truth just as much as you. I'm not a bad man, Mr. Harkness.
Jack: Captain.
Stewart: I'm not a bad man, Captain. I'm not a good one either. I'm a middle man in every sense of the word. And faced with the thought of being who I am for God knows how long, I'm just as keen as you to find out exactly what's going on. Especially with the stock market threatening to collapse, a man like me needs insurance. You don't believe me. You think I'm the epitome of evil, the devil in a three piece suit.
Jack: In my experience, that's how it works.
Stewart: You're experience must be rather simple. You have a rather archaic view of good versus evil, don't you?
Jack: Tell me who's behind this.
Stewart: I've been trying to find out. I've sent agents all over the world following the paper trail, the backroom deals, the holding companies within holding companies. That's when I came face to face with the true face of evil.
Jack: The system itself.
Stewart: Precisely. If the schemes and conspiracies are being plotted, then they must be seen only as patterns, waves, shifts that are either too small or too vast to be perceived. Someone is playing the system right across planet Earth with infinite grace, beyond any one person's sight. No, I'm sorry, Captain, but PhiCorp isn't controlling this. Profiting, yes, but this is part of a much larger design way beyond any of us.
Jack: But how can you be part of it and not know what's going on?
Stewart: Let me give you an example. These warehouses full of drugs, no doubt you'd love to uncover an incriminating memo dated the day before Miracle Day signed by me authorising the stockpiling of painkillers. The truth is, a pattern like that began say maybe five years ago with the systematic increase in production in random factories around the world, based on market share projections. What was the warehouse?
Jack: Washington DC, Third and Boston.
Stewart: I'd imagine transportation of the drugs to the Third and Boston was then carried out over a twelve month period by, say, maybe five different haulage companies outsourced to seven or eight different independent suppliers.
Jack: So that means everyone's to blame.
Stewart: Everyone and no one. Whoever's behind this, they don't show themselves. Not to me, not to you. But to play the system like thisâ€”the markets, the politics, industryâ€”they had to be planning this for a very long time. I wish I knew who they were.
Jack: I was told that the miracle involves geography. Does that mean anything?
Stewart: No. But there is one word that my operatives picked up dating back to the mid-nineties and then erased.
Jack: What is it?
Stewart: The Blessing.
Jack: What does it mean?
Stewart: There was a document from Italy, from a source inside the Council of Ministers. A contact then-deceased. It simply referred to the Blessing. It said, "They have found The Blessing."

Out of all the shit we have seen, all the bloodshed, all the horror...You know what is worse than all that? I loved it. I bloody loved it. And I'd keep telling Rhys I was sorry, and I'd say to little Anwen I'm sorry, but I loved it so much. I knew things no one else knew and, oh, I felt so special. And when we lost people, it was so, so big, and I could say it was worth it. Because the bigger it was, the more important I was. And the more people we lost, the more that meant I was a survivor...and I was better than them. My God, this is all my fault and now they've got my beautiful little girl and I wished this on her.
Jack: I used to think the same about Torchwood.

Esther: You think you're clever, Oswald? Is that really all you had?

Esther: Harry Bosco isn't a man. Harry Bosco's a process. It goes back to Vietnam. It was the first war to be televised and the government didn't want US networks taking feed directly from the Vietnamese, because for the first time information was beyond their control. So they put agents into every newsroom, every major TV network, filtering the output for the public. Cleverest of them all was a man called Harry Bosco.
Jack: What did he do?
Esther: He'd alter information. It was subtle. He did it by mistranslation. He couldn't censor or change, but he could manipulate the English translation. Change one word, change the entire meaning. If you say victims instead of bodies, you influence public opinion. All the channels Harry Bosco these days.

Rhys: No, no, no. I've got, I've got better plans for you, bub.
Oswald: And that's your problem, isn't it, Gwen? You can't let me walk free. Not a man with my desires. And you can't have me arrested. Not now that I know all about your little plans.
Rhys: They can leave you here with me.
Oswald: Well, that's just it, you joyous man. You've just trapped your wife completely. Leave me here with him and I think he would. I actually think he would. Your husband would kill me. He'd make me Category One with his own bare hands. You would kill me, wouldn't you?
Rhys: Yeah.
Oswald: Is that what you want? No. I'm coming with you. There's no choice. There's not a choice in the whole of the world. Okay?

The Mother: You must feel terrible.
Jilly: No, I'm fine.
The Mother: No, I mean you really must. That's what The Blessing does to you the closer you get. You're scared, am I right? Your skin's a little too tight. There's something just out of the corner of your eye you can't quite see, hmm?
Jilly: Yes.
The Mother: You never get used to it. Come this way, Miss Kitzinger.
Jilly: It's Miss Meredith.
The Mother: I don't really care. The men enjoy those sorts of games. But the feeling, it started as soon as we dug deep enough. I think it's The Blessing's attempt to communicate.
Jilly: Then it's a living thing?
The Mother: Oh, we have no idea. But certainly The Blessing sends some sort of impact back at the onlooker. [Jilly is led to a warehouse and into a goods lift] We have a theory. We say The Blessing shows you to yourself. I've seen people look upon The Blessing and end their lives. There's a brilliant truth about that, because each and every time that person was hiding something vile. Isn't that wonderful? It's exhilarating, the damage it does. I wonder what you'll see.

[Gwen discovers that Jack's wound is getting worse]
Gwen: Idiot. You idiot. You told me that was healed. You're not better at all, are you? Let me see.
Jack: Sorry.
Gwen: It's okay. I got you. Okay, I got you. I got you.
[Gwen helps Jack onto a bunk bed]
Jack: I'm so sorry.
Gwen: It's all right. Don't be sorry. I've got you. Okay, let me take a look. Oh, honestly. [rips off his bandage] Oh, God.
Jack: Gwen...
Gwen: If I had known it was this bad, Jack, you'd never have come.
Jack: It got worse when we arrived. Ah!
Gwen: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I got you.
[Oswald watches as a drop of Jack's blood drips from the bandage onto the floor then moves across the floorboards]
Jack: Fine place to die, in old Shanghai.
Gwen: You're not dying. Don't say that.
Jack: I'm tired, Gwen. This mortal life, it hurts so much.
Oswald: Well, now. Can't say I've been to China before, so I'm not well versed in their customs. But I've got to say I never knew about that. [Jack and Gwen also watch the travelling blood drops] Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Gwen: It's your blood. No wonder it's killing you. I think, I think it's showing us the way. It's The Blessing. It's somewhere over there. And I think whatever it is, it's calling you, Jack.

The Mother: I knew it.
Jilly: What's happening?
The Mother: You're about to meet the creator.
Jilly: It's that soldier.
The Mother: Hmph.
Jilly: He's with Oswald?
[As Gwen, Jack and Danes come down in the lift, the Mother goes to meet them. Her guards have their guns ready]
The Mother: Captain Jack Harkness. At last.
Oswald: No, no, no, no, this isn't about Jack. No, ma'am. Excuse me, but it's not at all. My name is Oswald Danes. Well. Hmm. Good evening, Miss Kitzinger. You've been promoted. And this is the new empire you're servicing? My, my, my, my, my, my, my.
The Mother: With all due respect, Mr Danes, you're a by-product of the Miracle. Not really relevant at all.
Oswald: That's what the Captain said. He tried to tell me that my life has become a very small thing. Tiny. And yet right here, right now, at the very end, I would describe myself differently. I would call myself vital. [Danes opens his coat to reveal a suicide jacket of explosives. He arms the trigger] Madam, you're a fine woman. You should be careful now, very careful indeed. It seems like you've been planning some kind of an explosion, but I'd love to make sure you're still inside.
Jack: Advantage Torchwood.
The Cousin: Well, I'm afraid we have a major disagreement here in Buenos Aires. I'd say advantage Families. Say hello to your friends.
Jack: What's that supposed to mean?
Rex: He means us.
Gwen: Rex? Oh my God. And Esther?
Esther: I'm here. They caught us.
Gwen: Just glad to hear you're alive.
The Cousin: I'll swap your standoff for my standoff. [aims his gun at Esther's head]
Rex: Don't you do it.
The Cousin: But nobody dies. She'll keep on living, just perforated.
Rex: Threaten me, you coward, not her.
Esther: Rex. Hey, I'm okay.
Jack If you hurt her, we've got explosives here ready to go.
Oswald: And don't imagine I won't. Whatever happens here tonight, there's no place on Earth that I can go, and I wasn't planning on coming out of here alive.
The Cousin: [lowers his gun] So, who's gonna lose their nerve first?
Jack: The thing is, we don't need explosives or guns or threats, because I've got the most powerful thing of all. [walks to the cleft in the world and cuts his finger. His blood flies into it] It wants me. Mortal blood. The only one in the whole world. So I suggest you're very careful with me, okay?
Oswald: And if you fail to take the Captain's advice, you can certainly come to oblivion with me. Jack, you're the future man. You've seen wonders beyond this world, so tell us of these Blessings and Miracles.

Rex: So, you found The Blessing and you worked out this morphic field.
The Cousin: The Blessing exists in a symbiotic relationship with the human race. It transmits a morphic field around the planet, binding us together like magnetism, like sunlight.
Esther: But finding it wasn't enough. You had to experiment on it.
The Cousin: No, we fed it.
The Mother: We fed it the blood of an immortal. We had one remarkable artifact. We found a second remarkable artifact. The combination was inevitable.
Gwen: So the Blessing absorbed the blood, copied it like a new template. So, the system changed its setting.
Jack: You know why it did that? I think you hurt it. It was being attacked, so it took the blood pattern and made it a gift. It's exerting itself to sustain every person on the planet. This whole Miracle, it's trying to be kind.
Rex: You've seen immortality. I'm living it. Why would you want this?
The Cousin: This is only stage one.
Gwen: But you ruined the world out there!
The Mother: The Miracle shocked the economy. The economy collapsed. We tear down in order to rebuild. And now it's almost within sight. The new world.
Gwen: Yeah, with no room for the poor, the weak or the ones that don't fit in.
The Mother: That's the way the world works. Now, we're just making it official. The families have just been waiting. Now we can step in to control the banks. The banks control government. The government controls people. Soon we'll be able to decide who lives, how long, where and why.
Jilly: It's about time!
Gwen: Oh, great. So it's the world according to Kitzinger, is it?
Jilly: Listen, you can bleed your liberal heart all over the place, but are you really gonna tell me the world was working before? Because I have worked for the rich and the powerful and the obese. I have stared into the high end of Western society and let me tell you, it is like shovelling an open sewer. These families, they want to make the world fitter, more compact, more disciplined. And I like the sound of that. That sounds like salvation.
Jack: But before you launched this brave new world, you had to deal with one more thing. Yeah. Me.

Esther: So as soon as the Miracle happened, you sent the Torchwood email.
The Cousin: His blood endangers the plan. We had to draw him out into the open.
Jack: Well, you failed. I got to Shanghai. I've got the only mortal blood on the planet. If it gets into The Blessing, life switches back. I can make the whole world mortal.
[As Jack is about to slit his wrist, the Mother laughs]
The Mother: No.
The Cousin: Oh, no.
The Mother: Sadly not.
The Cousin: He's not listening.
The Mother: He doesn't seem to get it.
The Cousin: No, no, no.
The Mother: Polar dynamics, Jack.
The Cousin: Everything on this axis operates in a polar dynamic field.
The Mother: You could reset the Blessing, your blood could make the whole world mortal again, but only by introducing it to both cities at once.
The Cousin: Blood in Buenos Aires.
The Mother: Blood in Shanghai.
The Cousin: Entering The Blessing simultaneously.
The Mother: That's how we fed it.
The Cousin: That's how we made the world immortal.
The Mother: And for you, I'm sorry, it's impossible.
The Cousin: You did very well, almost worked it out, but all that spare blood of yours went up in flames.
The Mother: So I'm just gonna have to kill you. [gives an order to her Chinese henchmen]
Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa.
The Mother: Jack, I know how your mind works. Even now you're ferociously calculating how you can get your blood to the other side of the world. But I can't allow that. Absolutely not.
Oswald: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I'm warning you, I'll do it.
The Mother: Then I'll die. And that's a shame, because you can blast his blood into that wall and it won't make any difference at all.
[The henchmen cock their weapons]

Rex: Listen to me.
Oswald: I'll do it! I'll do it!
Rex: Wait a minute. If you need the blood of Jack Harkness on the other side of the world, then just-
Oswald: I'll do it!
Rex: Just listen to me! Jack! All right. I'm all right. As I was saying, if you need Jack's blood, how about this?
[Rex cuts his finger, and the blood flows to the cleft. The ground shudders]
The Mother: What was that? What happened?
Gwen: Rex, what did you do?
The Cousin: That's impossible. No way. There's nothing special about you.
Rex: Oh, but there is, when I've got Jack's blood flowing through my veins. It's inside me.
Gwen: What?
Jack: Oh, my God.
Rex: See, we knew this blood was important, so as soon as we arrived-
Esther: We transfused it into Rex. We exchanged his blood for Jack's.
Rex: On most days it might've killed me. But we're all living on Miracle Day.
Esther: And everyone thought the blood was gone, so no one even suspected. All we did was keep one final bag, filled the rest with Rex's blood, and Jack's mortal blood...
Rex: ...Just walked right in. Hey, Oswald, you want to be a walking bomb?
The Mother: Get him out of there!
Rex: Well, try this. Shoot me! Shoot me! Come on! Shoot me!
The Cousin: Don't! Don't! Don't!
Rex: Pull that trigger! Splatter my blood! Shoot me!
The Mother: Get him out! Get him out!
[Jack produces a gun]
Jack: Nobody move! Huh? Wow, Rex, you're a genius!
Rex: You just shut the hell up. All right? This shit hurts.
Gwen: Yeah, we've got blood on both sides of the world, Jack, but-
The Mother: But they will die. Is that what you want? The Blessing will take every last drop. You'll both die, gentlemen. You'll both kill yourselves. You will die in a pit in Shanghai. Is that what you want?
Jack: I think I've lived long enough. Are you ready, Rex?
Rex: Oh, you know I wish I'd never met you, you World War Two idiot. Good times, huh?
Esther: Yeah.
Rex: I'll see ya.
Gwen: Just one last thing, Jack.
Jack: What is it?
Gwen: You're never gonna be a suicide. [aims her gun at him]
Jack: Thank you.
Gwen: Bye, then.
Jack: Bye.
Gwen: Face front.
[Jack faces the Blessing]
Jack: This is it, Rex.
Rex: Nothing's gonna stop me.
The Cousin: I think this might. [shoots Esther]

Jack: There's nothing we can do. I'm, I'm sorry, Gwen. I am so sorry. He's dead. [Rex gasps back to life] [shocked] What?!
Rhys: What?!

Jack: Whoa! [pushes a filling cabinet off of him] What happened? Was it the Rift? [runs out of his office] Gwen? Ianto? You okay?
Ianto: No broken bones. Slight loss of dignity. No change there, then.
Gwen: The whole city must have felt that! All of South Wales!
Jack: I'm gonna take a look outside! [leaves]
Ianto: [looks at a computer screen, stunned] Little bit bigger than South Wales.

Jack: [disaprovingly] Ianto! Time and a place!
Ianto: Eh...It is funny, though.
Jack: Gwen, come and see!
Gwen: [on her phone] Rhys, I have no idea. Just...stay indoors. And I need you to phone my mother. Tell her, oh I dunno, tell her to take her pills and go to sleep. I'm gonna come home as soon as I can. I promise. I love you, you big idiot. [hangs up, then joins Jack and Ianto]
Jack: Someone's established an artificial atmospheric shell. Keeping the air and holding in the heat.
Ianto: Whoever's done this wants the human race alive- that's a plus. Twenty-seven planets, including the Earth.
Gwen: No, but what's that? [indicates a red dot on the screen] That's not a planet!

Jack: Not a word. Where are you?
Martha: New York.
Jack: Huh. Nice for some...
Martha: I've been promoted; Medical Director on Project Indigo.
Jack: Did you get that thing working?
Martha: [surprised] Indigo's top secret, no one's supposed to know about that.
Jack: I... met a soldier in a bar. [Ianto looks at him] Long story.
Ianto: [sharply] When was that?
