Spike: Look on the bright side, Twilight, the Princess arranged for you to stay in a library! Doesn’t that make you happy?

Shining Armor: And she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be in the wedding was so that they could meet Canterlot royalty! And if she hasn't been on her best behavior with your [stomps hoof] friends, it's because with me being so busy, she's had to make all the decisions about the wedding!
Twilight Sparkle: I was just trying to–
Shining Armor: She's been completely stressed out because it's really important to her that her big day be perfect! Something that obviously wasn't important to you. [Twilight gasps] Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and comfort my bride. And you can forget about being my best mare. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all.

Princess Cadance: Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake. Clap your hooves...
Twilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance: ...and do a little shake.

Princess Cadance: She's a changeling! She takes the form of somepony you love and gains power by feeding off you're love for them!

Queen Chrysalis: Right you are, Princess. And as queen of the changelings, it is up to me to find food for my subjects. Equestria has more love than any place I've ever encountered. My fellow changelings will be able to devour so much of it that we will gain more power than we have ever dreamed of!

Queen Chrysalis: Soon, my changeling army will break through. First, we take Canterlot. And then, all of Equestria!

Rarity: (gasps) She does! She absolutely does!
Twilight Sparkle: Don’t be ridiculous. I don’t even know him. He just—
Pinkie Pie: (rapid fire) Totally reminds you of a guy you met in the other world who played guitar and was in a band and helped prove you didn’t destroy all the decorations for a big dance, so you could still run for Princess of the big dance, and then asked you to dance at that dance, Right?!
(Long pause)
Twilight Sparkle: How did you know that?
Pinkie Pie: Just a hunch.

(Sunset Shimmer gives the Dazzlings a tour of Canterlot High)
Sunset Shimmer: That's the science lab...computer lab is in there...oh! (She shows the poster of the Musical Showcase.) We're having a big musical showcase this weekend. The whole school is pretty much rallying around it.
Adagio Dazzle: A...musical showcase?
(They look at each other mischievously.)
Sunset Shimmer: I’m sure since you’re new, Principal Celestia would let you sign up if you’re interested.
Aria Blaze: We have been known to sing from time to time.
Sonata Dusk: Helloooo?! We sing, like...all the time. It’s how we get people to do what we want.
(Adagio motions for her to be quiet)
Sonata Dusk: Wha...what’d I say?
Adagio Dazzle: What you meant to say, was that being in a musical showcase sounds like a great way to meet other students.
Sonata Dusk: (giggles) Oh, yeah, what you said I meant to say, that’s what I meant. To say.
Aria Blaze: (groans) And what you would have said if you weren't...the worst.
Sonata Dusk: YOU are!
Adagio Dazzle: You'll have to excuse them. They’re idiots.
Sonata Dusk and Aria Blaze: Hmmph!

(The Dazzlings are about to cause the students in the cafeteria to argue with their singing)
Adagio Dazzle: This is it, girls. The moment we’ve been waiting for...
Sonata Dusk: Lunch?!!
Adagio Dazzle: Ohh...the chance to get our true Equestrian magic back.
Sonata Dusk: Oh. Right.
Adagio Dazzle: Our voices are just strong enough to make them want something so badly, they’ll fight to get it.
Aria Blaze: So we’re just gonna do what we always do? Stir up some trouble and then feed off the negative energy? Some plan, Adagio.
Adagio Dazzle: It won’t be the same as the times before! There is Equestrian magic here, their negative energy will give us the power we need to get this entire world to do our bidding.
Sonata Dusk: But we can get lunch after, though, right? (She sees a poster announcing:) It's Taco Tuesday!!!
Adagio Dazzle: Just follow my lead.
Aria Blaze: Or my lead.
Adagio Dazzle: My lead!

Adagio Dazzle: (faking concern) Oh, no! No one's mingling! It's like...there’s some kind of underlying tension that could bubble to the surface at any minute.
Sonata Dusk: It’s the fruit punch, isn’t it? I knew I used too much grape juice!
Adagio Dazzle: It’s not the fruit punch! It’s us!
Aria Blaze: But the punch is awful too.
Sonata Dusk: What do you know about good fruit punch?!
Aria Blaze: More than you.
Sonata Dusk: Do not.
Aria Blaze: Do too.

(Trixie has just trapped the Rainbooms under the amphitheater stage)
Adagio Dazzle: Told you someone would give them a shove.
Sonata Dusk: She didn't shove them, she pulled the lever!
Aria Blaze: Ugh, go back to sleep, Sonata.

(The Rainbooms are trapped under the amphitheater stage)
Applejack: Give it up, Rainbow Dash. You’ve been tryin’ at this for hours, it’s not gonna open.
Twilight Sparkle: Maybe it doesn’t even matter that we’re trapped down here. I don’t think the counter-spell would’ve worked anyway.
Applejack: ’Course it woulda worked, Twilight. (To Rainbow) Assumin’ a certain band member didn’t try to hog the spotlight the whole time we were tryin’ to play it!
Rainbow Dash: Hey! If you want to tell Twilight she’s getting a little too caught up trying to be the new leader of this band, you don’t have to be all cryptic about it.
Rarity: She was talking about you, Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash: Me? I’m just trying to make sure my band rocks as hard as it needs to.
All sans Twilight and Sunset: OUR BAND!
Twilight Sparkle: But why wasn’t it working? I should know what to do! How can I not know what to do? How can I have failed like this?
Applejack: It might have been your idea to start a band, but it’s not just your band, Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash: I’m the one who writes all the songs!
Fluttershy: I write songs, you just never let us play any of them!
Rarity: I had the most perfect outfits for us to wear!
Applejack: Again with the costumes! No one cares what we’re wearin’!
Rarity: I care, Applejack! So sorry if I enjoy trying to make a creative contribution to the band!
Pinkie Pie: Hey! Anybody here remember fun?! I’ll give you a hint: IT’S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF BEING IN THE RAINBOOMS!!!
Rainbow Dash: I WISH I’D NEVER ASKED ANY OF YOU TO BE IN MY BAND!!!
Rarity: I WISH I’D NEVER AGREED TO BE IN IT!!!
Applejack and Fluttershy: ME NEITHER!!!
(They start to argue, and their negative energy wafts upward.)
