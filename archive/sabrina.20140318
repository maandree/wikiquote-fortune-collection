Sabrina: Are you kidding? I’d love to meet the Violent Femmes. When? Where?
Harvey: Well they’ll be signing CD’s at Music City in Boston tonight at midnight.
Sabrina: Midnight! That’s perfect. I have no conflicting plans. But I still have to ask my aunts.
Harvey: Just tell them what I told my parents. It’s an astrology field trip.
Sabrina: Don’t you mean astronomy?
Harvey: Wow, they’re paying even less attention than I thought.
Sabrina: This’ll be so much fun. You, me and the Violent Femmes.
Libby: (Turing around from the next table) You’re going to see the Violent Femmes?
Harvey: Yeah.
Libby: You have to let me come with you. (Moves to sit down by Sabrina) I will do anything to meet Gordon Gano. You know I hate this word but... Please? The more the merrier.
Sabrina: (After Harvey gives her a look) All right, you can come.
Libby: Thanks! This is so great. I love the Violent Femmes.
Gordie: (Overhearing their conversation) You’re going to see the Violent Femmes? Can I come too? (He sits at their table beside Harvey)
Libby: No! Jeez Gordie, you can’t just invite yourself along.
Sabrina: I thought you just said ‘The more the merrier’?
Libby: Twist my words, why don’t you.
Harvey: Look. It’s my car and I say any Femmes fan is welcome. So Gordie, you’re in.
Gordie: Cool!
Harvey: Cool!
Sabrina: Cool!
Libby: Shotgun!

Harvey: You have to let us in. I mean talk about Violent Femmes. If they don’t meet the band there will be four extremely violent femmes, and I’m the one who has to drive them all back to Westbridge along with one love-sick dude. Do not make me do that. You know what I’m saying, you’ve been there right?

Zelda: Thank Zeus!

Salem: I couldn't resist power, (weeping) but I'm weak. I'm sorry, Sabrina. I didn't want to hurt you; I just wanted to rule you. (Sabrina makes a weird face; Salem faces the Witch Judge) Your Honor, I'm ready to be a cat again.
Witch Judge: Sabrina, once again, you dodged the bullet (Sabrina smiles) That´s the name of the lion, "Bullet"

[Sabrina has been sent out to deal with a rampaging dinosaur]
Sabrina: Okay, I'll just engage it in friendly conversation and maybe it'll go away. What language do giant lizards speak? Of course, Japanese. [casts a spell on her throat, making her speak Japanese] Takor, aday Toyota noya shin chah domo masu? ["So, what do you think of the new Toyotas?"]
Dinosaur: [speaking French] Je ne comprends pas. Je parle français. Est-ce distillateur l’ère Mésozoïque? ["I don't understand. I speak French. Is this still the Mesozoic era?"]
Sabrina: [to herself] A French dinosaur. I only wish this was the strangest thing I've ever encountered. [casts another spell on her throat, making her speak French] Vous êtes dans la chance. Ils ont un centre ville de festival de viande. Un bon nombre de sauces crèmes. ["You're in luck. They're having a meat festival downtown. Lots of cream sauces".]
Dinosaur: Non possible! ["No way!"]
Sabrina: Possible. ["Way."]
Dinosaur: Merci, porc Américain culturelement illettré. Au revoir. ["Thank you, culturally illiterate American pig. Toodles."] [stomps away]
