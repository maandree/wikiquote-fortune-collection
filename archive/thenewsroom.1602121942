Will: Sharon, the NEA is a loser. Yeah, it accounts for a penny out of our paycheck, but he gets to hit you with it any time he wants. It doesn't cost money, it costs votes; it costs airtime, column inches. You know why people don't like liberals? Because they lose. If liberals are so fucking smart, how come they lose so goddamn always?
Sharon: Hey-!
Will: [without letting her finish, he directs his attention to Lewis] And with a straight face, you're gonna tell students that America's so star-spangled awesome, that we're the only ones in the world who have freedom? Canada has freedom, Japan has freedom, the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Australia, Belgium has freedom. [laughs] So 207 sovereign states in the world, like 180 of them have freedom.
Will: And yeah, you, sorority girl. Just in case you accidentally wander into a voting booth one day, there's some things you should know, and one of them is, there's absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world. We're 7th in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, 3rd in median household income, number 4 in labor force, and number 4 in exports. We lead the world in only 3 categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next 26 countries combined. 25 of whom are allies. Now, none of this is the fault of a 20 year old college student. But you, nonetheless, are without a doubt a member of the worst, period, generation, period, ever, period, so when you ask, "what makes us the greatest country in the world?" I dunno know what the fuck you're talking about! Yosemite? [Pause] It sure used to be. We stood up for what was right. We fought for moral reasons, we passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons, we waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors. We put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chest. We built great big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, and we cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars, acted like men. We aspired to intelligence, we didn't belittle it, it didn't make us feel inferior. We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in our last election, and we didn't [sighs] we didn't scare so easy. We were able to be all these things, and to do all these things, because we were informed. By great men, men who were revered. First step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. America is not the greatest country in the world anymore. [Pause, then to the moderator] Enough?

Will: Good evening. I'm Will McAvoy. This is News Night, and that was a clip of Richard Clarke, former counterterrorism chief to President George W. Bush, testifying before Congress on March 24, 2004. Americans liked that moment. I liked that moment. Adults should hold themselves accountable for failure. And so tonight I'm beginning this newscast by joining Mr. Clarke in apologizing to the American people for our failure. The failure of this program during the time I've been in charge of it to successfully inform and educate the American electorate. Let me be clear that I don't apologize on behalf of all broadcast journalists, nor do all broadcast journalists owe an apology. I speak for myself. I was an accomplice to a slow and repeated and unacknowledged and unamended train wreck of failures that have brought us to now. I'm a leader in an industry that miscalled election results, hyped up terror scares, ginned up controversy, and failed to report on tectonic shifts in our country. From the collapse of the financial system to the truths about how strong we are to the dangers we actually face. I'm a leader in an industry that misdirected your attention with the dexterity of Harry Houdini while sending hundreds of thousands of our bravest young men and women off to war without due diligence. The reason we failed isn't a mystery. We took a dive for the ratings. In the infancy of mass communications, the Columbus and Magellan of broadcast journalism, William Paley and David Sarnoff, went down to Washington to cut a deal with Congress. Congress would allow the fledgling networks free use of taxpayer-owned airwaves in exchange for one public service. That public service would be one hour of air time set aside every night for informational broadcasting, or what we now call the evening news. Congress, unable to anticipate the enormous capacity television would have to deliver consumers to advertisers, failed to include in its deal the one requirement that would have changed our national discourse immeasurably for the better. Congress forgot to add that under no circumstances could there be paid advertising during informational broadcasting. They forgot to say that taxpayers will give you the airwaves for free and for 23 hours a day you should make a profit, but for one hour a night you work for us. And now those network newscasts, anchored through history by honest-to-God newsmen with names like Murrow and Reasoner and Huntley and Brinkley and Buckley and Cronkite and Rather and Russert-- Now they have to compete with the likes of me. A cable anchor who's in the exact same business as the producers of Jersey Shore. And that business was good to us, but News Night is quitting that business right now. It might come as a surprise to you that some of history's greatest American journalists are working right now, exceptional minds with years of experience and an unshakeable devotion to reporting the news. But these voices are a small minority now and they don't stand a chance against the circus when the circus comes to town. They're overmatched. I'm quitting the circus and switching teams. I'm going with the guys who are getting creamed. I'm moved that they still think they can win and I hope they can teach me a thing or two. From this moment on, we'll be deciding what goes on our air and how it's presented to you based on the simple truth that nothing is more important to a democracy than a well-informed electorate. We'll endeavor to put information in a broader context because we know that very little news is born at the moment it comes across our wire. We'll be the champion of facts and the mortal enemy of innuendo, speculation, hyperbole, and nonsense. We're not waiters in a restaurant serving you the stories you asked for just the way you like them prepared. Nor are we computers dispensing only the facts because news is only useful in the context of humanity. I'll make no effort to subdue my personal opinions. I will make every effort to expose you to informed opinions that are different from my own. You may ask who are we to make these decisions. We are Mackenzie McHale and myself. Miss McHale is our executive producer. She marshals the resources of over 100 reporters, producers, analysts, technicians, and her credentials are readily available. I'm News Night's managing editor and make the final decision on everything seen and heard on this program. Who are we to make these decisions? We're the media elite. We'll be back after this with the news.

Will: [holding a bag of pot cookies] Just to be clear for you youngsters, this isn't recreational. It's medicinal. When I was a junior in high school, I was already throwing a 74-mile-an-hour fastball, which puts a lot of stress on your landing leg. I also have epicondylitis in my elbow due to my mess-you-up breaking ball.
Kaylee: You know, if you just want to bake, that's okay with me. You don't need to go to WebMD to come up with symptoms.
Will: I don't want to bake. I'm telling you I was an awesome high school athlete, but it's left me in constant physical pain in my knee and elbow. And experts say that medical marijuana relieves the pain and inflammation with fewer side effects than prescription pain killers.
Kaylee: Which experts?
Will: The ones on WebMD. Anyway, thank you and thank your friend in LA for getting this for me.
Kaylee: No problem. He said they're pretty strong. So you should just break off a quarter and eat that.

Will: Good evening. From New York City, I'm Will McAvoy. ACN is now able to report and confirm that for the first time in almost three decades, the world has no reason to fear Osama bin Laden. In just a moment, in a live address to the nation, the president will announce that in a coordinated operation under the cover of darkness, US Special Forces tonight killed the leader of al-Qaeda and the mastermind behind the deadly attack of September 11th, 2001. It's been nine years, seven months, and 20 days since America's most wanted criminal took from us 2,977 American sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, friends and colleagues. We were transformed that morning into a different nation, more fearful and so, of course, more hostile. And while nothing, not even this victory our country has waited for for such a long time, can bring back the souls lost on that terrible morning in New York City, in Virginia, in a field in Pennsylvania, and all across America and the world, let tonight serve as a welcome reminder that throughout our history, America's darkest days have always been followed by its finest hours. Here now, from the East Room of the White House, the President of the United States. [goes into the presidents address]

Mac: [upset] I really can't deal with this right now—
Sloan: [raising her voice] Stop avoiding this! I just got off the phone with these guys. Listen to these quotes. These aren't from liberals. These are hardcore Wall Street guys who, whatever the world may think of them, know what they're talking about and so do I. Jamie Dimon at Chase says: "Voting against raising the debt ceiling would be a moral disaster." The Barclay's guys say "This debate is detached from reality." My Goldman source says: "If the House Republicans continue this debate, I hope they're willing to mark the end of the dollar as the Global Reserve Currency." Please notice that he didn't say: "If the House Republicans don't raise the debt ceiling." HE SAID: "If the House Republicans continue this debate." That's all it takes. Just the uncertainty. That's why the Dow is gonna close down 230 points today. Because just the debate. Just the doubt. Just the possibility that the House Majority might commit the greatest self-inflicted damage to [raising her voice] the country since the SECESSION OF THE SOUTH has caused billions in value to disappear."

Maggie: What does God's voice sound like? [everyone laughs] I'm completely serious. She's saying that God spoke directly to her. How is this not the first question asked in a debate? How's it not the only question? What does His voice sound like? What did He say exactly word for word? Did He speak in Hebrew? Acadian? Kiswahili-Bantu? And to put it in a medical context, is this the first time you've heard voices? She's claiming to be a prophet. The whole world is sitting on the edge of their seat. How is this not the first question we'll ask?
Jim: First of all, can you stop pointing at me and saying "she" and "her"?
Maggie: You're the one who wanted to play a woman. But tell me why that question is out of line.
Jim: Because it's not the best way to demonstrate seriousness of intent and it's not the best way not to insult people.
Maggie: Which people?
Martin: Christians. 83 percent of the country.
Maggie: I'm one of them. And she's insulting me!
Jim: Please, stop pointing at me when you are–
Maggie: Relax, J. Edgar. She's insulting me, she's insulting my family, she's insulting my congregation, and she's insulting my faith. She's implying that Christians are imbeciles who will believe anything while reducing God to a party hack who endorses political candidates. Now, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is the first time since Moses that God has given direct instructions to someone other than His son. But if so, I think it deserves a follow-up.

Will: [broadcasting] During Tea Party rallies and campaign speeches, we have been told that America was founded as a Christian nation, and that if the Founding Fathers were here today, they'd tell us so. Here's John Adams in the Treaty of Tripoli: "As the Government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion..." And here's Thomas Jefferson: "... That our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions." And here's the First Amendment to the US Constitution: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." What's more frightening than the perversion of our great history is that sensible, smart, strong Republicans, the very men and women who should be standing up to radical fundamentalism, are so frightened of losing Primary battles to religious zealots that they've thrown in the towel on sanity. So we get this:

A producer comes up from D.C., he wants to make a name for himself in New York. He chases a story that's not there. And the story - it's not a kitten up a tree.

We go to air, 48 hours it takes for the story to come undone, and with it Atlantis Cable News, ACN is brought to its knees! The producer's surgical strike is discovered, and that producer is fired. Does he write an open letter to the New York Times apologising to the public, his colleagues, the three-star General and US Armed Forces? No, he sues us for wrongful termination.

I believe in market solutions and I believe in common sense realities and the necessity to defend ourselves against a dangerous world and that's about it. Problem is now I have to be homophobic. I have to count the number of times people go to church. I have to deny facts and think scientific research is a long con. I have to think poor people are getting a sweet ride. And I have to have such a stunning inferiority complex that I fear education and intellect in the 21st century. But most of all, the biggest new requirement, really the only requirement, is that I have to hate Democrats. And I have to hate Chris Christie for not spitting on the president when he got off Air Force One. The two-party system is crucial to the whole operation. There's honor in being the loyal opposition. And I'm a Republican for the same reasons you are. So I hope your voice gets louder in the next four years.

Sloan: Okay, let me say...
Don: Go ahead.
Sloan: Here's what we are...
Don: Bring it.
Sloan: I love spending time with you.
Don: H-ho, oh man...
Sloan: Wait.
Don: I can't believe I'm being Don Keefered.
Sloan: You're not! I would never Don Keefer you.

[As Jim and Maggie's flight to Cuba, which Edward Snowden failed to board, prepares to leave, and they discover his empty seat is opposite theirs]
Jim: We had seats across the aisle from him. The honeymooners had two seats across the aisle from Edward Snowden. Boris and Natasha had the golden tickets. We'd have had him the whole flight, except for one thing -
Maggie: [concurrently with him] He's not on the plane.
Jim: You know where he is?
Maggie: Probably back in the airport.
Jim: Yeah. So we are flying 600 miles an hour away from the story... FUUUCK!!!
Maggie: [after a short pause] Why didn't you call her?
Jim: What?
Maggie: Why didn't you call Hallie?
Jim: You're a noodge, Maggie. You know that?
Maggie: I'm just asking. If you really like her, it's a stupid thing to -
Jim: [cutting her off] I like you... And I don't know why you don't know that.
Maggie: [after a moment of shocked silence] Beca- Because if you wanted to be with me, you'd be with me.
Jim: That's just... not at all true. You were with Don when I met you.
Maggie: [angry] You never called me from New Hampshire.
Jim: Yes I did.
Maggie: No you didn't. Ever! And you knew I'd split up with Don, and you knew why - you went through Lisa, you went through Hallie, and you never called me from New Hampshire, so it's really not as obvious as you think it is, and it's also probably not true.
Jim: You may be right... It's not, but it had... Potential. But the last thing was unambiguously wrong.
Maggie: What language are you using?
Jim: I do like you. I like you, and I'm glad I said it. Even though... now I wish I'd... said it at the end of a 13-hour flight.
Maggie: Yeah, this is going to be uncomfortable. [goes to unbuckle her seatbelt] I'm gonna switch seats with someone.
Jim: I'll switch seats. I'll sit in Snowden's seat.
Maggie: That's not far enough. It's gonna be weird if we can see each other.
Jim: Okay.
[He gets up, picks up his bag and moves a few rows back, where he asks someone to switch seats, leaving Maggie looking visibly shaken by their argument]

[Jim is watching Star Trek on his iPad, when Maggie's fingers appear and tap the screen, getting his attention]
Maggie: Follow me. [seeing he hasn't heard, she pushes his headphones back] Follow me.
Jim: Where are we going?
Maggie: Exactly where you think we're going.
[He gets up and follows her]
Jim: I don't know what... I'm confused.
[As they shuffle down the aisle, the plane jerks, and a flight attendant approaches]
Flight attendant: We're running into turbulence. You have to go to your seats and put your seat belts on.
Maggie: [as she squeezes past the attendant] This is awkward.
Jim: I was sitting far away from you. I was watching episode four.
Maggie: [to the man that Jim switched seats with] Excuse me, would you mind trading back?
Man: We are in the middle of turbulence.
Maggie: It's nothing. It's due to the action of molecular viscosity called laminar flow.
Man: [tiredly] Okay.
[He gets up and leaves]
Jim: Where did that come from?
Maggie: Sit down. Put on your seatbelt.
[They sit down and put on their seat belts. Without another word, Maggie kisses Jim]

Sloan: And we're joined now by Bree Dorrit, Editor of ACN Digital and Father of the ACNgage app. Thanks for joining us, Bree.
Bree: Hi Sloan.
Sloan: We saw it in some of the package we just played, but tell us about ACNgage.
Bree: It's a map that tells you where celebrities have been sighted in New York and Los Angeles, and soon we'll be expanding to Vegas and South Beach. Anytime you want, you can scroll around and see, you know, Jude Law was shopping for condoms at Duane Reade on 57th or...
Sloan: So people are out there, and they can post a message to us and say "Kristen Bell and her kid are at the 4pm showing of How to Train Your Dragon at the ArcLight?"
Bree: And it goes right on our map instantly.
Sloan: So that when Kristen Bell and her kid come out of the movies, there are a dozen sociopaths waiting for them?
Bree: [chuckles nervously] I don't think that's likely.
Sloan: Why not?
Bree: Well, it's the price of fame, isn't it?
Sloan: No. It's not. It's a punishment for it. Celebrities have been stalked, and celebrities have been murdered. What this app is best at is assisting in that, right?
Bree: I'm sorry you feel that way. ACNgage is citizen journalism.
Sloan: Can you talk about the vetting the "citizen journalism" undergoes?
Bree: The vetting?
Sloan: People can post more than locations. They can post observations.
Bree: That's right.
Sloan: I'm asking if those posts are fact-checked.
Bree: This is one specific element of the site -
Sloan: [cutting him off] For instance, in a post today, a citizen journalist tells us that [reads her notes] Jimmy Kimmel was visibly intoxicated last night in the Soho House in West Hollywood.
Bree: That's right.
Sloan: Jimmy Kimmel was with his family in Cabo San Lucas last night.
Bree: [faltering] People don't read this with the expectation of it being true. Everyone's -
Sloan: Excuse me?
Bree: Everyone -
Sloan: People don't have an expectation that what they're reading is true?
Bree: They read it for the immediacy.
Sloan: But you're using the word "journalism" which means that there is an expectation that what they're reading is true. But let me take it a step further. Let's pretend it was true, that Jimmy Kimmel was intoxicated last night at the Soho House in West Hollywood. It's not true, but we don't care, so let's pretend it is, since that's what we're doing anyway. Why does that belong on our website?
[In the production room, an operator raises a hand to get Mac's attention]:
Mackenzie: Leave her on as long as she wants.
[Back in the studio]
Bree: Honestly, I think there is a shifting definition of what's public and private space.
Sloan: There is, and we should care about that. But my question is - why should we care about a talk show host drinking at a bar?
Bree: Don't you think it's great that we're not putting people up on a pedestal and worshipping them anymore?
Sloan: I don't think celebrities are one of the bigger problems facing us, but aren't we the ones building the pedestal? You've got a map that gives us their location.
Bree: The idea is that we are acknowledging that they're real people.
Sloan: I wonder how many of us didn't already know that. But you're doing more than acknowledging they're real people. You're beating them up for it.
Bree: Aren't they protected by the piles of money they're surrounded by?
Sloan: Okay. What's the line of demarcation? You make over x dollars a year, and now you get to be treated by us as a regular person who's basically had an electronic bracelet slapped on their ankle. What does x equal?
Bree: It would be silly to name an exact dollar amount.
Sloan: You're paid $55,000 dollars a year.
Bree: Well, that's private!
Sloan: Sorry. But that's almost twice the national average for a family of four. Do your piles of cash protect you from this interview in which I'm intentionally stripping you of your dignity? And by the way, I've managed to do it without lying once. So I'm going to give you another chance to answer my question before I answer it myself: What's the value of an unsourced, unvetted story about a grown man drinking at a bar? [Bree just stares at her in shocked silence, unable to find any meaningful answer] I can't give you all the time in the world, it's entertainment. My concern isn't for the celebrities, even though as sure as we're sitting here, someone is gonna get hurt. My concern is for the rest of us, who you're turning into a wild pack of prideless punks. [turns to smile at the camera] That's news night for June 24th. I'm Sloan Sabbith, filling in for Will McAvoy. Terry Smith is up next with the Capital Report.
