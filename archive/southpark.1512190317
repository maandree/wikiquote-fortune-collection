Instructor: Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress—and a volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here, we see the Stevens family enjoying on their picnic. But suddenly, daughter hears a noise: it's a volcano. Junior seems worried—but have no fear, Junior. Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt. [Jane uses a picnic blanket, covering her family] That's right, Jane—duck and cover.

Kyle: Wait, I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want this marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use marklars to try and force marklars to believe their marklars. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with marklar. These marklars have no good marklar to live on marklar so they must come here to marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, or marklars.
Chief-Marklar: [slight pause; the humans look confused] Young one, your marklars are wise and true.

Announcer of the ADA: Fellow dentists! As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth-fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this: A giant half-chicken, half-squirrel, that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest, for genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring. We believe also, that the creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra, and that it...
Dr Foley: Excuse me, I think I have a more logical theory!
Announcer: Well, by all means, Mr Foley, enlighten us!
Dr Foley: I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit!
Announcer: [all laughing] Oh, Mr Foley! You realize how ridiculous that sounds?
Dr Foley: It's not ridiculous, it's very possible. I've seen it happen before!
Announcer: Where?
Dr Foley: In Montreal.
Announcer: [more laughing] And where, pray, is this "Montreal"?
Dr Foley: Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!
Announcer: Very well, Mr Foley! You go on your wild goose chase, and meanwhile we'll deal with the real problems at hand.
Dr Foley: I will! [leaves]
Announcer: Ha ha ha! Anyway, the half-chicken, half-squirrel would most likely be about 3-4.5 feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a floatation device.

Sister Anne: In the book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said "Eat this, for it is my body."
Cartman: So we won't go to Hell as long as we eat crackers.
Sister Anne: No no no no!
Butters: Well, what are we eating then?
Sister Anne: The body of Christ!
Stan: No no no, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals...so he turned himself into crackers and then told people to eat him.
Sister Anne: No!
Stan: No?!
Butters: I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
Sister Anne: Look, all you need to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it. Okay?
Boys: Okay...
Sister Anne: And then you will drink a very small amount of wine. For that, is the blood of Christ.
Cartman: Oh come on now, this is just getting silly.
Sister Anne: Eric, do you want to go to hell?

[Cartman has been confessing his sins, unaware of who is in the other side of the confessional]
Cartman: And that was about everything from first grade. And then last year...you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
Father Mackey: Your confession does not leave this box.
Cartman: Okay, because last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
Mackey: Oh. Well, I'm sure he would forgive you...if he...knew.
Cartman: No but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my buttcheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it.
Mackey: [annoyed] I see.
Cartman: And then this other time, I went peepee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week. And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog, and I went number two on the sidewalk, and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog, so then the priest got fined like $100 for not picking it up. And then this one time, I put superglue all over the priest's bottom...

I couldn't even sit down, so... I-I had to tell my mother, wh-which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a-and he told me... I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and Cartman has his own theme park.
Stan: ...Kyle, I-I understand what you mean, but—
Kyle: Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes! And every week I try to better myself! I'm always saying, "You know, I learned something today", and what does this so-called God give me in return?! A hemorrhoid! It doesn't make sense! WHAT IS YOUR LOGIC!?!? Ow...

Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop."

Father Maxi: It is sometimes hard, in times like these, to understand God's way. Why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, shouldn't be driving? It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple "man walks into a bar" joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again.

Chris Hansen: Take a seat, right over there. [Cartman walks over]
Cartman: How does he do that?
Chris Hansen: You know, one time, I was doing a show called "To Catch a Predator," and we almost caught this pedophile, but then he ran from us because he didn't want to be on "Dateline." So we tracked him down at his house, and you know what he did? He shot himself. It'd be a shame if you didn't want to be on "Dateline." It'd be a shame if we had to track you down and you shot yourself.
Cartman: I just peed my pants! [covers his mouth, shocked]

[Cartman is looking for a leprechaun. If he sees it, Kyle will suck his balls; if not, he will owe Kyle $10. This is the plot of the whole trilogy]
Kyle: This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
Cartman: [setting up a trip wire between two stones] It isn't a story; it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now. [drops the rope, walks forward, and whips out a walkie-talkie] Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
Clyde: This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by.
[Jimmy, Jason, and Craig are hoisting the net into place]
Cartman: Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out.
Kyle: Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home.
Cartman: Oh, no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember? [whips out his walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Blackie. What's your six, Blackie?
Token: [rather pissed off] I don't want the code name "Blackie."
Cartman: Code names are what they are, Blackie. Check your six and alert when in position. [puts away the walkie talkie and gets back to setting the trip wire]
Kyle: This is fucking retarded.
Cartman: Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechaun shows up, you must suck my balls. Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. [finishes setting the trip wire]
Kyle: Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me $10. Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
Cartman: [whispering loudly] Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet? [whips out the walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
Butters: [on a lookout platform with a telescope next to him; in subdued manner] This is Faggot. Go ahead.
Cartman: Faggot, I need you to keep surveillance north to northeast. Check back in five.
Butters: Okay, will do. Faggot out. [turns right and looks through the telescope, then exclaims]
Kyle: Okay, that's enough. Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
Cartman: It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
Kyle: You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
Butters: Uh, I got somethin'! I got it! [the other boys turn and pay attention] It's, uh, oh, jeez, I think it's a leprechaun!
Cartman: [to Token] Set off diversion track C! [Token sets off a small bomb under a pile of leaves. Nearby a leprechaun skips into view, then stops upon seeing the boys]
Stan: Dude.
Jimmy: F-Fuck me, it's a leprechaun.
Cartman: [charging forth] Get it! [the leprechaun runs away, and the boys give chase] Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive!
[the leprechaun crawls under a tree trunk and gets up. He trips over a rope and a net descends on him; he dodges it and runs off. He runs into a bush and trips a sliding door, which drops down behind him. It traps him in a cage. He looks around for a way out, but sees the boys crowd in]
Butters: Wow.
Stan: Cool.
Craig: No way.
Token: Whoa.
Jason: Wow.
Cartman: [making his way through, out of breath] Agh. Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
Leprechaun: You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!
Cartman: [gets out a Bowie knife] Tell me where the gold is or you die! [unsheaths it] Slow!
[the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him out and disappears]
Stan: Where'd he go?

Leprechaun: I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near! :[makes a rainbow with his right hand and disappears. The group then turn back at Kyle]

I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same can be said for Bugs Bunny and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the earth. Doesn't that make them kind of real? They might be imaginary, but they're more important than most of us here.

Announcer: And now, the exciting conclusion of Terrance and Philip: Blood Rage... (a "Special Presentation" graphic appears onscreen)...will not be seen tonight so that we bring you this Queef Sisters special! (The "April Fools" graphic seen at the beginning of Not Without My Anus appears again, with the accompanying kazoo honk.) The Canada Channel presents... The Queef Sisters, Katie and Katherine Queef! Two Toronto girls who love shooting air out of their vaginas! (Cut to several stills of the titular sisters doing just that...)
(Cut to a gynecologist's office. The Queef Sisters are both in stirrups as the doctor comes in.)
Doctor: All right, Queef Sisters! It's time for your yearly Pap smear and vag exam!
Katie (pleasantly: All right, Doctor!
Katherine (equally pleasant): I'm ready, Doctor! (The doctor walks over to Katherine.)
Doctor: Now I'm just going to check for cysts... (he puts his head down between Katherine's legs, and not even two seconds later, she queefs, blowing his hair back. Repulsed) Ugh! (The sisters laugh, not unlike Terrance and Philip would.)
(Cut back to the kids watching this spectacle in disgust.)
Cartman (disgustedly): What the fuck is this?!
(Cut back to the gyno's office.)
Doctor (sternly): Now, listen here! If you queef in my face, then I refuse to be your gynecologist!
Katherine (apologetically): I'm sorry, Doctor, I had air trapped in my vagina.
Doctor: Well, just don't let it happen again! Now, I'm just going to check for cysts. (Again, he assumes the position. Again, Katherine queefs. Again, they both laugh hysterically. Now he's really mad...) Now, stop it! That isn't funny! Babies come from there! (Once again, he assumes the position. Need we elaborate on what happens next? He slams down his notepad in disgust.) That does it! No Pap smear for you! (points at Katherine)
Katherine: But, Doctor, what if I have cancer?
Doctor (unmoved): You should have thought about that before you queefed in my face three times!
(Cut back to the kids. They're even more confused and disgusted than before, but it's leaning more towards disgust.)
Butters (confused): They aren't gonna show Part Two of The Terrance and Philip Show?
(Back to the gyno's office.)
Katie: Doctor, my sister's just being difficult. Maybe you could examine my cervix instead!
Doctor: Well, all right...Now I'm just going to check for cysts... (You know the rest. Thoroughly repulsed, he throws down his notepad again.) That does it, Queef Sisters! I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore! (He storms out of the exam room, slamming the door behind him.)
Katherine (innocently): Oh, Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry.
Katie (innocently): I guess so, Katherine...

Philip: What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
Terrance (equally disgusted): Queef Sisters?!
Brian: That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.
Terrance (incredulous): You replaced our show with this? But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
Philip: That's sick!
Brian: You think farts are funny, why not queefs?
Terrance (annoyed because it's so obvious): Because babies come from there!
Brian: Hey, look, guys! Women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience--you know, women empowerment and the get-go! So we want to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry, guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gone stale!

(Cut to the porch. Terrance and Philip are smoking cigarettes and bemoaning their position.)
Terrance (sighing): What the hell am I going to do, Philip? She makes me so mad sometimes!
Philip: Katherine just won't stop queefing...but I don't know if could live without her...

Philip (contrite): Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
Terrance (equally contrite): Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.

Operator: Thanks for calling the Food Network hotline. Billing is $9.95 for each 60 second period. To accept, say "Creme Fraiche".
Randy: Creme Fraiche.
Amanda: Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to?
Randy: Oh, hi, I just, uh, thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
Amanda: I'm making a pan roasted chicken.
Randy: Pan roasted? Like seared on the stove and then put in the oven?
Amanda: Uh-huh. I'm just taking the chicken out of the pan. It's so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes.
Randy: Yeah?
Amanda: Yeah. Ooh, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.
Randy: You gonna deglaze that fucking pan?
Amanda: Oh, I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?
Randy: If I was there I would. I'd take some red wine - about a quarter cup - and then a wooden spoon and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
Amanda: I got a wooden spoon right here. It's pretty hard.
Randy: Yeah, you gonna put some onion in while you're deglazing?
Amanda: I was thinking about shallots actually.
Randy: Oh yeah, shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavor. Fuck yeah.
Sharon: [picking up phone] Randy Marsh!
Randy: Ah! Sharon!
Operator: Your time on Food Network hotline has expired. To add more time, say "Creme Fraiche".

(Cartman and his mother Liane are in Best Buy looking at iPads.)
Liane: Here, look at this one... a Toshiba HandiBook.
Cartman (offended that Liane would even suggest such a thing): A Toshiba HandiBook?!
Liane: This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.
Cartman (bratty): Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everybody's going to think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
Liane (stern): Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba HandiBook, or you can have nothing at all! (There is a pause while Cartman considers this.)
Cartman (even snottier): I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms, because we should at least be safe if you're going to FUCK ME, MOM!!!
Liane (sharp): Eric!
Cartman (butter his ass, he's on a roll!): You might as well buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! (Cartman's meltdown has attracted some very unwelcome attention.) Do you wanna fuck me, Mom?! Just say so! (Cartman yanks down his pants and presents his ass to Liane, who is totally mortified.) GO AHEAD, MOM, FUCK ME!! FUCK ME RIGHT IN THE BEST BUY!! YOU WANNA FUCK YOUR SON SO BAD?! GO ON!! FUCK ME! FUCK ME!!!!
(Cut to the car, not long after that. Cartman is sobbing while Liane simply looks straight ahead at the road.)
Liane (angry): Stop crying, Eric! I told you that if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
Cartman (contrite): But I told you I was sorry...
Liane (not convinced): You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!
Cartman (innocontrite): But I wasn't get you in trouble.
Liane: Then why did you go outside to the police officer and say "HELP HELP MY MOM IS TRYING TO FUCK ME!"
Cartman: Oh wait. I get it now. The "F" word is a no-no word. and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry, Mama!
Liane: If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything.
Cartman: (sniffles) Well, no, that doesn't really have any logical sense, mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad... Mama. Please can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
Liane: (Yelled): No!
Cartman: (Sniffles) Well, then could we at least pull up here and get some dinner? Cause I liked to be wined and dined after I've been FUCK!

"What a great day for Canadians everywhere! The Winnipeg drummers, playing the "March of 1000 Farts"...as is traditional for the Canadian Royal Family."
"People in attendance, now gently tossing Cap'n Crunch as the prince passes by...as of course is tradition."
"Ah, here she comes! Yes, there she is! The aboot-to-be princess of Canada. Isn't she ravishing? So pure of heart, so strong in body, so hot in the face....She is indeed the living symbol of our greatly country. My God, she's beautiful."
Scott: (loud, booming voice) Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum I smell Kraft dinna.
Canadian General: You're a dick, Scott! You have always been a dick! And then you got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now you're a giant dick!
Scott: No! You all kept calling me a dick and that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!
Ugly Bob: Don't worry. If there's one thing eskimos are good at, it's finding things.
Scott: Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blow job once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and ask me to pay her! God damn polar gooks.
Ike: STOP BEING A DICK, SCOTT!
Scott: Oh, so now I'm a dick?!

Butters: ...and so then... And so then, it turns out that the Terminator secretly had a kid ten years ago, meaning Terminator could be his own father, and then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
Kyle: No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
Butters: Skeletor's real?
Stan: No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Butters: Skeletor's a lady?
Cartman: [enters the cafeteria in rage] GODDAMMIT! WHO THE FUCK DO THEY THINK THEY ARE?! THIS IS THE LAST FUCKING STRAW! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!!!!!

Kyle: You get in trouble again, Cartman?
Cartman: NO, I DIDN'T DO A DAMN THING! Nothing! I told you, this school is a den of snakes! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys.
Stan: Dude, we're just trying to eat.
Cartman: Oh, you think i'm overreacting again, huh?! No! Not this time! [shakes the table again] The school has gone too far this time and it affects each and every one of you!

Cartman: Let me guess - i'm in trouble again!
Principal Victoria: You're darn right, Eric!
Cartman: For what?!
Victoria: Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
Cartman: [points at her] Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
Victoria: ...What?
Cartman: I don't care if Obama IS president! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the lengths of their DICKS!
Victoria: Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physicals?
Cartman: You're damn right! 1.2 inches. I'll have you know that MY penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!
Victoria: The numbers we put up were height differentials!
Cartman: What?
Victoria: We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.
Cartman: ...Those weren't our dick sizes?
Victoria: WHY would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?!
Cartman: I don't know! Why would you?!
Victoria: We didn't!
Cartman: [gets off the chair] Aw, crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
Victoria: This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen! This time, you've done it to yourself!
Cartman: Oh, god! Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
Victoria: Because you have an anger problem, Eric!
Cartman: [points at her] FUCK YOU! No I don't!

Old Lady: [On phone] What are you waiting for? Kill yourself!
Dean: Alright, God-dammit we got another comedian; ever since that little kid called up, now everybody wants to call and tell, me I should kill myself.
Old Lady: [On phone] He was right. Do it.
Dean: Folks, this is an 800 number. Every time you call and tell me to kill myself, it's costing us two dollars and thirty six cents. So now how about a caller who wants to buy jewelry? Yes, hello sir?
Old Man: [On phone] You're too scared to do it, aren't ya? You don't have the balls.
Dean: God-dammit, I'm not scared to do it.
Old Man: [On phone] Nah, you're scared. You got lady balls. [Hangs up]
Old Lady 2: [On phone] Hello? I'm calling about the peridot earrings.
Dean: Yes mam.
Old Lady 2: [On phone] They'd look good on your dead body. Why don't you kill yourself.
Dean: All right, that's that. That there's the straw that broke the camel's back. I've got a gun right here; what do you think about that?
Old Lady 2: [On phone] Put it against your temple, and pull the trigger.
