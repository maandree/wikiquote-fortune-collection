Steve: Oh, well, thank you.
Jesse: You're welcome. Steve, I'd like to help you because, uh, quite frankly, you need help. See, when you're walking, you gotta kinda be loose, man, like let it be cool. (starts to slowly bounce) That's it. Loosen up, be very fluid. Be very fluid-y. That's it! Now... once you get it going, you shift the weight and you go. (starts walking) And it's a strut, and it's cool, and it's a strut, and it's cool. See? Like that?
Steve: Very inspiring. (tries to walk, but instead of a strut, he walks sideways on his toes bouncing highly)
Jesse: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, uh, that's close.
Steve: Really? Well, oh. Well, that was a walk on the wild side. But, you should try it with your elbows out. It's much better for circulation.
Jesse: Oh, really? Like this? (sticks elbow out)
Steve: Yeah. (Jesse starts to walk) You're doing fine!
Jesse: You, know? I do feel the blood flowing better.
Steve: Yeah.
Jesse: It's very - WHAT AM I DOING?
