Commercial: Veridian Dynamics. Doing the right thing. It's important. What does it mean in business? We have no idea. We know what wrong is. Actually, no, we don't. Because we're a successful company, not some boring ethics professor. Veridian Dynamics. Right and Wrong. It means something. We just don't know what.

Ted: The Germans are worried about working with us because ironically, they think that Veridian is ruthlessly efficient and bent on world domination.
Phil: Wow. That's like when those Irish auditors thought our accounting department drank too much and wrote overly depressing poetry.

Veronica: A female mentor would have been very valuable for a young Veronica, bursting with potential, yet vulnerable, like a fawn in the woods, but tough, like a fawn in the woods with a machine gun.
Linda: So you're saying you, or this terrifying, murderous fawn, could have used some guidance?
Veronica: Yes, we would have liked that. We're going to raise more money for this charity than it ever has before. The forest will run red with the blood of woodland creatures who doubted little Veronica and will now pay with their furry little lives.
Linda: There's really no middle ground with you. Either you don't care at all, or you care 100-and-crazy-percent.
Veronica: What else is there? Now saddle up Linda, and say goodbye to common sense.

Linda: No. We're not done here. This woman opened her heart, and that happens so rarely you could hear the hinges squeek. I will not let you slam that rusty heart door shut.
Veronica: Go Linda, release your anger!
Linda: You will not crush this woman's spirit and love, you spineless, condescending bureaucrat.
Veronica: Good Linda, only your hatred can destroy him!
Linda: You sir, are a bad egg!
Veronica: Yes, now strike!
Linda: [after headbutting man]: Wow. Where did that come from?
Veronica: I am a good mentor!

Ted: I Convinced Lonny, the odd guy who works in the oddly cold computer room, to keep the cadaver for a while. Might be a little creepy at first, but the cadaver'll get used to him.

Veronica: It's not fair, all you people with your kids...Pal-ing around after hours, networking, advancing your careers. And I get left behind just because I don't want to turn my uterus in to a human veal farm.
Ted: Well, some call it the miracle of life, but okay....

Chet: Look at that...I've never seen Olivia so crazy for anyone as she is for your daughter. Kids...There's just no rhyme or reason to some of the ridiculous things they get attached to.

Ted: [voiceover] How do you convince an eight-year old girl to go to a party she doesn't want to go to? I have no idea. So, I thought I'd ask someone who used to be an eight-year old girl.
Linda: Get her a beautiful, sparkly, pink party dress and a princess tiara. If she doesn't want it, I've got an event coming up I'd wear it to.
Ted: Actually, getting Rose a dress is a great idea. Thanks, Linda! You really are a girl!
Linda: Yes, I am. And it's not just the genitals. It's a whole lifestyle.

Lem: Our self respect demands a harsh response.
Phil: We're thinking about bringing her a coffee and a bagel every morning. Then, when she's grown accustomed to it, we'll inexplicably stop it.
Ted: Guys, why don't you just talk to Linda? Tell her your feelings are hurt and ... Wait a second, you guys stopped bringing me a bagel and coffee two weeks ago!
Phil: You know what you did.

Phil: Let's get her a bagel and some coffee. It is time to start laying the groundwork for pain. In three to six weeks, she's not going to know what hit her.
Lem: I don't know if I can wait that long. We need another plan. Something with more bite that doesn't take weeks, and weeks, and often goes unnoticed.

Veronica: Working on Galaxy Omega would be so exciting—being able to communicate with animals. I've always wanted to tell a giraffe how stupid it looks.
Chet: I've always wanted to ask a baboon why they're called baboons; it's such a ridiculous name. Baboon!
Ted: There may be other applications, beyond insulting animals. Like, learning about the environment.
Veronica: Ugh, don't we have enough humans complaining about that? Now I've got to listen to some hippie bear whining that I'm eating all his salmon!

Ted: [whispering] We'll spread a rumour that we broke up. Then, when our pretend relationship's over, we can go back to being friends again
Linda: [whispering] That's a great idea! In fact, it's such a great idea, why wait for a rumour to spread? [loudly] You no good louse!
Ted: Oh dear.
Linda: That's right, Crisp. I'm breaking up with you, right here and right now.
Ted: Oh, then it's over. Bye. [Tries to leave]
Linda: You wanna know why?
Ted: Actually, I said "bye," not "why."
Linda: Ok, I'll tell you why. Because you're selfish. Everything is about your career, your job, your... hair! Then, after you neglect me, you realise how spectacular I am and you try to make it with gifts. Oh, the gifts!
Ted: I sound like a monster...
Linda: The jewelery, flowers, clothes, cattle. Cattle? Yes, cattle! What were you thinking?
Ted: Uh, they looked smaller in the catalog?
Linda: Well, they were huge. And you and I are through!
