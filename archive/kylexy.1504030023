Steven: Watch it! Watch it! It's hot! Ow! Ah!
Kyle: This being was clearly a superior communicator. I somehow understood everything it said, and wondered why others chose to speak so ineffectively.

Kyle: [In mind] I was suffering from thirst, but my language skills were rather primitive, so I relied on phrases that I memorized at the children’s home. [Out loud, quoting the bully from the children's home] Yo! Let’s get some juice down here. (Family is stunned) ... Sup? Everyone taking stupid pills around here? Juice me!

Andy: (hugs Kyle as he opens the door to her) You're the best! Did you know that?
Kyle: Guess I do now. What's this for?
Andy: The other day when I was nervous about my test to see if the cancer was gone. (turns to Jessie) I don't really know you but... (hugs Jessie) Anyway, you were just there and you knew I needed a hug. (sees Amanda) I don't really know you either. (hugs Amanda)
Amanda: That's okay, hugs are good.
Josh: (just entering) What's all the loving for?
Andy: (hugs Josh and kisses his cheek) I was gonna text but too impersonal, then I was gonna call but again, digital. This is a strictly analog moment that should be shared with real time hugs and gushy feelings. My test results came back. I'm officially in remission! (everyone celebrates and Andy hugs Stephen Nicole and Lori)
Jessie: (to Kyle) What did you do?

Kyle: Its only fair.
Amanda: You may not know that...I love you.
Kyle: You do?

Kyle: (After the prom)There's a reason why people say we shouldn't expect too much,no one wants to see someone they care about end up disappointed. We instinctively act to protect our own from being hurt, and do what we can to make the right choices for people we love. But the reason we have expectations in the first place, is because we want to aim as high as we can. Because when you love someone, there's no limit to what you can accomplish.
