Tamsin: But do you want her to be?
Dyson: I did. But then a lady in a tree took my love away and by the time I got it back Bo had a girlfriend.
Tamsin: You forgot to start with "Once upon a time..."
Dyson: Once upon a time we never found the right time. The end.
Tamsin: What does love feel like?
Dyson: Are we really doing this? [she gives him a look] When you feel it you'll know it. And when it's gone you'll never want to lose it again. You know what, talk to Bo and Kenzi about this stuff, okay? It's really not my bag.

Kenzi: I cannot believe he Kenzi-proofed it. He's playing off my power.
Bo: How do we make you stop sparking?
Kenzi: Ugh. It kinda just runs out. You know, like sunscreen. Reapply after swimming. I guess I could take a shower but I really don't wanna get my hair wet, it's such an ordeal.
Bo: I hear ya.
Kenzi: You know what though, it's been like a week, I probably should wash it. Is Lauren's conditioner like the worst?
Bo: It's the worst.
Kenzi: Does it contain disinfectants? I mean God knows what that woman is putting in her hair. She can not be trusted.

The Keeper: [to Dyson and Kenzi] You have failed to abide by the sacred rules of the Fae. If you have any last words speak them now.
Kenzi: Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God.
The Keeper: The human has spoken for you then.
Kenzi: [to Dyson] I just stole your last words?! Oh my God, I suck!

Bo: You're quiet.
Dyson: It was intimate. You- In me for once. [referring to her being in his memories]
Bo: Such a way with words. [they chuckle]
Dyson: I could feel you. Sent you a message without even knowing it. Glad you got it.
Bo: Our minds work well together.
Dyson: Yes they do.

Kenzi: Oh my God mermaids! I love mermaids! But like love them.
Dyson: They are the psychopaths of the sea Kenz. "The seas have eyes" is their cultural motto.
Kenzi: I have lied awake at night my entire life thinking of the marvelous merday when I would meet a fin-flapping, seashell-bra wearing Daryl Hannah. Oh my God!
Lauren: They are a rare and fascinating species.
Kenzi: Yeah. They comb their hair with forks!
Dyson: Yeah. Right after they stab you in the face with them. Just before they blow up your ship that's on route to the new world.
Kenzi: Yeah, but then they sing to us with crabs.
Dyson: No they don't Kenzi.
