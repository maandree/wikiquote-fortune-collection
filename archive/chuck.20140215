You're beautiful, you're smart, you laugh at all of my stupid jokes and have a horrible habit of constantly saving my life. The truth is, you're everything that I thought I ever wanted and more. And for the last few days all I could think about is our future together. About what it's going to be like once I finally get the Intersect out of my head; we can be together for real, no fake relationships, no covers, no lies. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that you and I can never have a future together. I fooled myself into thinking that we could but the truth is: we can't. Because even if we had a real relationship it would never really be real. I'd still never know anything about you, your real name, your home town, your first love, anything. And I want more than that. I want to be able to call you at the end of a bad day and tell you about some funny thing Morgan did and not find out I can't but I can't cause you're off be somewhere in Paraguay quelling a revolution with a fork. I'm a normal guy who wants a normal life. And as amazing as you are, Sarah Walker, we both know that you will never be normal.

Sarah: No, I get it; he's your best friend.
Chuck: You know you say that, but I don't think you have a clue what it means. Look, Sarah, I don't have parents. I mean not really. I don't really talk about it because that's the way things are now. But it wasn't always this way. Morgan was there the first day that my mom took off. He didn't say much. Because honestly what is a fifth grader supposed to say? But we sat there and split a cherry cheesecake and played Legend of Zelda all night long. And my dad, well that's-that's a whole other story. But Morgan was there for that too. Morgan is more than just my best friend. He's my family. Before you got here, and long after you've gone, Morgan is my family.
Sarah: ...Last night we failed to learn the contents of the Triad's container. And now we don't know what kind of drugs or weapons are floating around in the city. And while I appreciate your friendship with Morgan, losing sight of that container endangers many people's best friends, not just yours, Chuck.

Jeff: Exactly what did you do?
Lester: Sugared the gas tank. It's an oldie, but a goodie. Man, I haven't sugged a tank in days. Anyway, now that they are incapacitated in the mobile sense, we need a plan.
Jeff: It should be keen and clever. Utilizing our unique talents.
Lester: Do we have any of those?
Jeff: I think you are uniquely wasteful and destructive.
Lester: Let's build on that.

Chuck: [about Jeff and Lester] I've worked with those guys for years. They may seem like botulism victims, but they're loyal. They can do it.
Casey: Lester, I'm gonna tell you something I never dreamed I'd tell you. Never dreamed I'd have to tell you. But the situation is extreme. This is Colonel John Casey of the National Security Agency.
Lester: That is so funny. There's a John Casey who works at Buy More.
Casey: That's me you idiot. I'm NSA. Sarah Walker, Chuck Bartowski, they're CIA.
Lester: They are so not.
Casey: They are "so" so, you colossal dope. Now I need you. My daughter needs you. And your country needs you.
Lester: Canada?
Casey: Patel, listen up. You do what I tell you, I'll make you a hero.
Lester: It's the call.
Casey: Go to my Crown Vic.

Lester: You're outgunned, outmanned, outside. And it's a lovely day. So throw down your gun and nobody gets hurt.
Quinn's henchman: You're the one who should be worried about getting hurt.

Jeff: Behold the flames of destiny. Ha, ha. [Jeff using flamethrower]

Morgan: Wow. It's all ending, huh?
Casey: What are you babbling about?
Morgan:Just getting nostalgic, you know? Quinn's dead, Sarah's home safe, so we're done, man. No more missions.
Casey: No more gunplay.
Morgan:Think about it, Casey. Five years. I went from pip-squeaky sidekick to this. And you, you were the most cold-blooded sniper in the whole world and now you're scrubbing our floors.
Casey: Well, if you would use a plate when you're eating taquitos, I wouldn't have to scrub the floors. would I? Do you really think I've changed?

[Casey enters Sarah's apartment]
Casey: Figure I'd find you here. You can put the knife down, I'm not here to fight. What do you remember about me?
Sarah: Your reputation mostly. Unfriendly, unforgiving... and unquestioning about your orders.
Casey: That's funny. When we met, people said the same about you. Probably why we never got along.
Sarah: Well, if we didn't get along, then why are you here?
Casey: [pulls out envelope ] I guess Bartowski's made us both a little soft. [puts envelope on table] Beckman's got a new job for me... but these past five years, we changed, you know? We became friends. Take care of yourself Walker.

Sarah: [on tape] Day one. My mission is simple. Find out what he knows, gain his trust, and monitor his actions until the agency can decide what to do with him......Day 21. Chuck came over to my hotel room today and brought me a pizza. Vegetarian, no olives. I think he's making it his mission to get to know me. It's sweet....Day 49. Chuck broke up with me today. Well fake. Fake broke up with me, technically....Day 56. Chuck and I were defusing a bomb today and there was a moment where we were sure we were going to die. He closed his eyes and I kissed him. I kissed him...Day 564. Things are calm for once. No missions, nothing. Nothing really to report... except I still find myself sitting here...talking to myself...because... because I love him... I love Chuck Bartowski, and I don't know what to do about it.

Morgan: Tell me why you are not returning Alex's phone calls. OK, she is worried sick about you. All she knows is you're gone, running covert missions.
Casey: They call them covert, numbnuts, because you don't tell anyone about them.
Morgan: She's your daughter.
Casey: She's a liability.
Morgan: Wow.
Casey: I didn't mean that, it's just that I have to be ruthless.
Morgan: What about Chuck and Sarah? Liability too? Right. Good. By all means lock 'em up, throw away the key. Lock away your feelings, forget everything that we've been through and you be ruthless.
Casey: You just don't understand, do you? I got soft. I lost my edge.
Morgan: Your team was your edge, you giant jackass. What is wrong with you man? You want to find Quinn, you know who to call. But don't you dare try to blame this on us because you're afraid. That right, you're afraid that when you're with us, that's when you're the best. And that's the truth man!
Casey: Hmmm.
Morgan: That's it, no response or anything?
Casey: Screw it.
Morgan: Screw what, John?
Casey: The court-martial....I'm in.
