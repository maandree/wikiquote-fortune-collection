Hipster #1: We need some...
Max: [snaps her fingers in his face every time she speaks] Is that annoying? Is that obnoxious and rude? Would you find it distracting if someone did that to you while you were working? Oh, you don't have a job. Sorry.
Hipster #2: Damn, dude, she burned you.
Max: Oh. [snaps her fingers in front of Hipster #2 too] No, hipster. No. Do not think we're on the same team. We have nothing in common. I wear knit hats when it's cold out. You wear knit hats 'cause of Coldplay. You have tattoos to piss off your dad. My dad doesn't know he's my dad. [turns to Hipster #1] And finally, you think [snaps her fingers in his face] this is the sound that gets you service. I think [snaps again] this is the sound that dries up my vagina.

Max: Yes, while having cocoa and splitting a hot dog.
Caroline: Oh, my God! That's, like, my dream "I love you" scenario! Why didn't you tell me sooner?
Max: Because when it comes to other people's creepy love stuff, that's when I'm a silent partner. And you need to stop with this creepy rom-com stuff, life isn't like a movie. Sometimes you're not a success right away. Sometimes you have to just eat it and be a cupcake. And sometimes you have to take your "I love you" whichever way it comes.

Max: There's no science to this trend stuff. It's all decided by one bitchy gay guy typing in his room, making it all up.

Caroline: Old-world charm. Pet-friendly. "What type of people live there?"
Max: Junkies, whores, homeless.
Caroline: Actors. "Do you have a hot tub?" Sometimes. "Gym?"
Max: Two. Gay Jim upstairs, and straight Jim across the hall who's only gay when he's drunk.
Caroline: "When is your space available? Always, sometimes, one time."
Max: Oh, just like our sex lives. Always for me, sometimes out of boredom, and one time for you.

Caroline: Oh, you made a Feliz Navidad cupcake! I'm muy proud of you. And I think we're gonna make muy mucho moolah when Manuel comes mañana.
Max: You're the only person I know who seems whiter speaking Spanish. [showing the cupcakes she made] Feliz Navidad for our Spanish-speaking friends. And for kids raised like me, "Feliz He's Not Your Dad." And then, "Joy to the World" for the normals, and for the hipsters, "Joint to the World." For the kids, "Frosty the Snowman." And for you, "Frosty with No Man."
Caroline: Well, I didn't see Jack Frost nipping at your nips either.
Max: Oh, here, this one's my favorite: "Santa Claus Is Coming"—

Caroline: Oh, my God, Max. My childhood bank!
Max: You had a childhood bank? I didn't even have a childhood.
Caroline: Come on, let's go. I stop in every few months to get caught on the security cameras, so people will think I'm still in the mix.
Max: Trying to get caught on security cameras? Whoa, we are different.
Caroline: Yeah, we'll just go in and while we're in here, well, I don't know, ask for a business loan.
Max: We are not getting a business loan! You tricked me into coming to the city. At least knock me out and put me in the trunk like a person.
Caroline: Okay, I hear you. No loan. But can we at least go in there so I can get a hit off some vault fumes and a complimentary Christmas cocoa?
Max: Yeah, I want one too. It's so cold out here my bra is suing my nipples for assault.

Sophie: I'm starting my own new business. So girls, you know how you have that $10,000? Well, I don't wanna clean you out, but how do you feel about tossing me $9,500?
Oleg: You two should invest. Sophie's business is genius. You know how a bunch of ladies got their down-there hair permanently lasered off?
Sophie: Yeah, that's when your waxer gives you a Michael Chiklis.
Oleg: Well, Sophie's offering a product that puts grass back on your field.
Caroline: That's not a business. That's nobody's business.
Max: Yeah, I don't do any of that stuff. I just throw a scrunchie on mine and go.
Oleg: Hey, there's a need for this. Sometimes, in the fog, my plane gets lost without a landing strip.
Caroline: We're out.
Sophie: Oh, don't decide yet, girls. You haven't even heard the cute little name—Sophie Kachinsky's Vagina Wigs!
Caroline: Yeah, we're really out.
Sophie: But it's a quality product, and it's real hair imported from va-China.
Caroline: Yeah, never been further out.

Max: Sophie, as honored as I am that you asked, it's just not really my thing, you know, man?
Sophie: Is this really not your thing? It's nobody's thing. You just do it 'cause you're supposed to, like bleaching your teeth or your anus.
Caroline: Thank God I'm off the list, 'cause that bridesmaid spa day is gonna be rough.
Max: Look, I'm sorry, it's just, I was a maid of honor in fifth grade when my mom married her cult leader. And then she was my maid of honor when I married him a week later, so... I'm kind of maid-of-honored out.
