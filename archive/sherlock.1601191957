Therapist: How's your blog going?
John Watson: Yeah, good. Very good.
Therapist: You haven’t written a word, have you?
John: You just wrote "still has trust issues."
Therapist: And you read my writing upside down. You see what I mean? John, you're a soldier. It's gonna take you a while to adjust to civilian life. And writing a blog about everything that happens to you will honestly help you.
John: Nothing happens to me.

Sherlock Holmes: [Unzips a body-bag, smiles at what he sees] How fresh?
Molly Hooper: Just in, 67, natural causes. He used to work here. I knew him, he was nice.
Sherlock: Fine. We'll start with the riding crop.
[Cut to Sherlock vigorously beating the dead body with a riding crop. He stops suddenly.]
Molly: Bad day was it?
Sherlock: I need to know what bruises form in the next twenty minutes. A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.
Molly: Listen, I was wondering. Maybe later when you're finished—
Sherlock: You're wearing lipstick. You weren't wearing lipstick before.
Molly: I, uh, I refreshed it a bit.
Sherlock: [beat] Sorry. You were saying?
Molly: I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee?
Sherlock: Black, two sugars please. I'll be upstairs.
[Sherlock leaves the room]
Molly: ...Okay.

John: [Looking around at the morgue's lab equipment] Bit different from my day.
Mike: You've no idea.
Sherlock: Mike, can I borrow your phone? There's no signal on mine.
Mike: And what's wrong with the landline?
Sherlock: I prefer to text.
Mike: Sorry, it's in my coat.
John: Er, here, use mine.
Sherlock: Oh, thank you.
Mike: This is an old friend of mine, John Watson.
Sherlock: Afghanistan or Iraq?
John: Sorry?
Sherlock: Which one was it? In Afghanistan or Iraq?
John: Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you...?
[Molly enters]
Sherlock: Ah, Molly, coffee, thank you. What happened to the lipstick?
Molly: It wasn't working for me.
Sherlock: Really? I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth's too small now.
Molly: ...Okay.
Sherlock: How do you feel about the violin?
John: I'm sorry, what?
Sherlock: I play the violin when I'm thinking and sometime I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.
John: You told him about me?
Mike: Not a word.
John: Then who says anything about flatmates?
Sherlock: I did. Told Mike this morning I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here he is, just after lunch, with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn't a difficult leap.
John: How did you know about Afghanistan?
Sherlock: Got my eyes on a nice little place in central London, we ought to be able to afford it. We'll meet there tomorrow evening seven o'clock. Sorry, got to dash, I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.
John: Is that it?
Sherlock: Is that what?
John: We've only just met, and we're going to go and look at a flat?
Sherlock: Problem?
John: We don't know a thing about each other. I don't know where we're meeting, I don't even know your name.
Sherlock: I know you're an Army doctor, and you've been invalided home from Afghanistan. You've got a brother worried about you, but you won't go to him for help, because you don't approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife, and I know your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid. That's enough to be going on with, don't you think? The name is Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon.
[He leaves. John glances at Mike.]
Mike: Yeah, he's always like that.

John: [upon first seeing Baker Street] Well this is a prime spot. Must be expensive.
Sherlock: Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, is giving me a special deal. She owes me a favour. A few years back her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out.
John: You stopped her husband from being executed?
Sherlock: Oh, no. I ensured it.

Sherlock: Brilliant! YES! Four serial suicides and now a note! Oh, it's Christmas! Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late. Put the kettle on. [Rushes out]
Mrs. Hudson: I had a husband like that once, always rushing about. But I can see you're more the sitting-down type. I'll get some tea, and you just rest your leg.
John: DAMN MY LEG! I'm so sorry. It's just sometimes this thing is just...

[In the back of a taxi]
Sherlock: Okay, you've got questions.
John: Yeah. Where are we going?
Sherlock: Crime scene. Next?
John: Who are you? What do you do?
Sherlock: What do you think?
John: I'd say private detective...
Sherlock: But...
John: But the police don't go to private detectives.
Sherlock: I'm a consulting detective. The only one in the world. I invented the job.
John: What does that mean?
Sherlock: It means whenever the police are out of their depth—which is always—they consult me.
John: [scoffs] The police don't consult amateurs. [Sherlock looks at him askance, then gives a sly smile.]
Sherlock: When I met you for the first time yesterday, I said "Afghanistan or Iraq?" You looked surprised.
John: Yes. How did you know?
Sherlock: I didn't know, I saw. Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military. But your conversation as you entered the room said trained at Bart's, so army doctor. Obvious. Your face is tanned, but no tan above the wrists: you've been abroad but not sunbathing. The limp's really bad when you walk, but you don't ask for a chair when you stand, like you've forgotten about it, so it's at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were probably traumatic: wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan: Afghanistan or Iraq.
John: You said I had a therapist.
Sherlock: You've got a psychosomatic limp. Of course you've got a therapist. Then there's your brother. Your phone—it's expensive, email enabled, MP3 player. But you're looking for a flat-share, you wouldn't waste money on this. It's a gift, then. Scratches—not one, many over time. It's been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man sitting next to me wouldn't treat his one luxury item like this, so it's had a previous owner. The next bit's easy, you know it already. [the back of the phone has been engraved "Harry Watson — from Clara xxx"]
John: The engraving?
Sherlock: Harry Watson: clearly a family member who's given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man's gadget. Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live. Unlikely you've got an extended family, certainly not one you're close to, so brother it is. Now, Clara: who's Clara? Three kisses says a romantic attachment. Expensive phone says wife, not girlfriend. Must've given it to him recently; this model's only six months old. Marriage in trouble, then—six months on, and already he's giving it away? If she'd left him, he would've kept it. People do, sentiment. But no, he wanted rid of it—he left her. He gave the phone to you, that says he wants you to stay in touch. [beat] You're looking for cheap accommodation and you're not going to your brother for help? That says you've got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife, maybe you don't like his drinking.
John: How can you possibly know about the drinking?
Sherlock: Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge. Every night he goes to plug it in and charge but his hands are shaky. You never see those marks on a sober man's phone, never see a drunk's without them. There you go, you see? You were right.
John: I was right? Right about what?
Sherlock: The police don't consult amateurs.
[Long beat]
John: [slowly] That was amazing.
Sherlock: [deadpan] You think so?
John: Of course it was. It was extraordinary. It was quite... extraordinary.
Sherlock: That's not what people normally say.
John: What do people normally say?
Sherlock: "Piss off!"

Sherlock: Did I get anything wrong?
John: Harry and me don't get on, never have. Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they're getting a divorce. And Harry is a drinker.
Sherlock: Spot on, then. I didn't expect to be right about everything.
John: Harry's short for Harriet.
Sherlock: [stops walking] Harry's your sister.
John: What exactly am I supposed to be doing here?
Sherlock: [starts to stride along] Sister!
John: No, seriously, what am I doing here?
Sherlock: There's always something.

Sherlock: Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.
Anderson: It's a crime scene. I don't want it contaminated! Are we clear on that?
Sherlock: Quite clear. And is your wife away for long?
Anderson: Oh don't pretend you worked that out! Somebody told you that!
Sherlock: Your deodorant told me that.
Anderson: My deodorant.
Sherlock: It's for men.
Anderson: Well of course it's for men! I'm wearing it!
Sherlock: So's Sergeant Donovan. [sniffs] Ooh... I think it just vaporised. May I go in?
Anderson: Now look, whatever you're implying—
Sherlock: I'm not implying anything. I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over. And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.

Sherlock: No.
John: Right, okay. You're unattached, just like me. Fine. Good.
Sherlock: [After an awkward pause] John, um... I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work and while I am flattered by your interest I'm—

Sherlock: [about the murder victim] Her coat is slightly damp; she's been in heavy rain in the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London in that time. Under her coat collar is damp too; she's turned it up against the wind. She's got an umbrella in her left-hand pocket, but it's dry and unused: not just wind, strong wind, too strong to use her umbrella. We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight, so she must have come a decent distance, but she can't have traveled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried. So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time? Cardiff.
John: That's fantastic!
Sherlock: Do you know you do that out loud?
John: Sorry. I'll shut up.

John: Seriously. This guy, a junkie? Have you met him?
Sherlock: John.

Sherlock: Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Lestrade: Ok, give me?
Sherlock: The bullet they just dug out of the wall is from a handgun. A kill shot like that over that distance from that sort of weapon, you're looking for a crack shot but not just a marksman, his hands mustn't have shaken at all so clearly he's acclimatised to violence. He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger so obviously has a strong moral principle. You're looking for someone probably with a history of military service and nerves of steel... [sees John and suddenly realises] Actually, you know what? Ignore me.
Lestrade: ...Sorry?

Sherlock: [sarcastic] Oh, you meant "spectacularly ignorant" in a nice way! Look, it doesn't matter to me who's Prime Minister, or who's sleeping with whom—
John: [somewhat bitterly] Or that the earth goes around the sun.
Sherlock: Oh God, that again! It's not important!
John: Not important? It's primary school stuff! How can you not know that?
Sherlock: Well, if I ever did, I've deleted it.
John: "Deleted it"?
Sherlock: Listen: [points to his head] This is my hard-drive, and it only makes sense to put things in there that are useful. Really useful. Ordinary people fill their heads with all kinds of rubbish, and that makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters! Do you see?
John: [brief silence; looks at Sherlock incredulously] But it's the solar system!
Sherlock: [extremely irritated] Oh, hell! What does that matter?! So we go around the sun! If we went around the moon or round and round the garden like a teddy bear, it wouldn't make any difference! All that matters to me is the work! Without that, my brain rots. Put that in your blog—or better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world!

Moriarty: Jim Moriarty... Hi. Jim? Jim from the hospital? Oh, did I really make such a fleeting impression? But then I suppose that was rather the point.

Moriarty: Don't be silly, someone else is holding the rifle. I don't like getting my hands dirty. I've given you a glimpse, Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse of what I've got going on out there in the big bad world. I'm a specialist, you see... like you!
Sherlock: "Dear Jim, please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover's nasty sister?" "Dear Jim, please will you fix it for me to disappear to South America?"
Moriarty: Just so.
Sherlock: Consulting criminal. Brilliant.

Sherlock: Yes you did.
Moriarty: [shrugs] Yeah okay, I did. But the flirting's over now, Sherlock; Daddy's had enough now! I've shown you what I can do, I cut loose all those people. All those little problems, even thirty million quid just to get you to come out and play. So take this as a friendly warning, my dear: back off. Although I have loved this, this little game of ours, playing Jim from IT, playing gay. Did you like the little touch with the underwear?

Moriarty: Westwood. Do you know what happens if you don't leave me alone, Sherlock, to you?
Sherlock: [Dryly] Oh, let me guess, I get killed.
Moriarty: Kill you? Um, no. Don't be obvious. I mean, I'm gonna kill you anyway, someday. I don't want to rush it, though. I'm saving it up for something special. No no no no no, if you don't stop prying... I'll burn you. I will burn... the heart out of you.
Sherlock: I have been reliably informed that I don't have one.
Moriarty: But we both know that's not quite true. Well, I better be off. So nice to have had a proper chat.
Sherlock: What if I was to shoot you now? Right now?
Moriarty: Well, then you could cherish the look of surprise on my face. Because I'd be surprised, Sherlock, really I would, and just a little bit... disappointed. And of course, you wouldn't be able to cherish it for very long. Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.

James Moriarty: Hello. Are you ready for the story? This is the story of Sir Boast-a-lot. Sir Boast-a-lot was the bravest and cleverest knight at the round table, but soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories about how brave he was and how many dragons he'd slain, and some of them began to wonder, "Are Sir Boast-a-lot's stories even true?" Oh no. So, one of the knights went to King Arthur and said, "I don't believe Sir Boast-a-lot's stories. He's just a big, old liar who makes things up to make himself look good." And then, even the king began to wonder, but that wasn't the end of Sir Boast-a-lot's problems. No. That wasn't the final problem. The end.

Chief Superintendent: Looked a bit of a weirdo if you ask me. They usually are, these vigilante types. [John stares at him] What are you looking at?
[Cuts to the Chief Superintendent nursing a bloody nose. John is slammed up against a police car next to Sherlock]
Sherlock Holmes: Joining me?
John Watson: Yeah, well, apparently it's against the law to chin the Chief Superintendent.

Sherlock Holmes: Ladies and gentlemen, will you please all get on your knees? [Firing the gun in the air] Now would be good!
DI Lestrade: Do as he says!

Lestrade: Derren Brown?! Let it go, Sherlock’s dead.
Anderson: Ah, is he?
Lestrade: There was a body. It was him, it was definitely him. Molly Hooper laid him out.
Anderson: No, she’s lying. It was Jim Moriarty’s body – with a mask on!
Lestrade: A mask? A bungee rope, a mask, Derren Brown. Two years and the theories keep getting more stupid. How many more have you got for me today?
Anderson: [Beat] Well, you know the paving slabs in that whole area, even the exact ones that he landed on, you know they were all...
Lestrade: [Interrupting] Guilt. That’s all this is. You pushed us all into thinking that Sherlock was a fraud, you and Donovan, you did this, and it killed him, and he’s staying dead. Do you honestly believe if you have enough stupid theories it’s going to change what really happened?
Anderson: I believe in Sherlock Holmes.

John Watson: The best man.
Sherlock Holmes: The best man...
John Watson: What do you think?
Sherlock Holmes: Billy Kincaid.
John Watson: Sorry, what?
Sherlock Holmes: Billy Kincaid, the Camden garroter. Best man I ever knew. Vast contributions to charity, never disclosed. Personally managed to save three hospitals from closure and ran the best and safest children's homes in North England. Yes, every now and then there would be some garrotings, but stacking up the lives saved against the garrotings, on balance I'd say ...
John Watson: For MY wedding. For me. I need a best man.
Sherlock Holmes: Oh right.
John Watson: Maybe not a garroter.
Sherlock Holmes: Gavin?
John Watson: Who?
Sherlock Holmes: Gavin Lestrade. He's a man and ... good at it?
John Watson: It's Greg. And he's not my best friend.
Sherlock Holmes: Oh, Mike Stamford, I see. Eh, he's nice. I'm not sure how well he'd cope with...

[Flash back to John and Sherlock standing in the kitchen at Baker Street. Sherlock dead silent, John waiting patiently.]

John Watson: Sherlock...
[Flash back to Reception]
Sherlock Holmes: I nonetheless promised that I'd do my very best to accomplish a task which, for me, was as demanding and difficult as any I'd ever contemplated. Additionally, I thanked him for the trust he placed in me and indicated that I was ...

Sherlock Holmes: ... in some ways very close to being moved by it.

John Watson: How was that?
Sherlock Holmes: Surprisingly OK.
[eyeball pops up in tea, floating on top]
John Watson: So you'll have to make a speech of course.
[Flash back to Reception]
Sherlock Holmes [flipping through his note cards]: Done that. Done that. Done that bit. Done that bit. Done that bit.
Sherlock Holmes: I'm afraid John, I can't congratulate you. All emotions and, in particular, love, stand opposed to the pure cold reason I hold above all things. A wedding is, in my considered opinion, nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world. Today we honor the death watch people, that is the doom of our society and, in time one feels certain, our entire species.
[crowd is silent and somewhat uncomfortable]
Sherlock Holmes: But anyway, let's talk about John.
John Watson: Please.
Sherlock Holmes: If I burden myself with a little help mate during my adventures it is not out of sentiment or caprice, it is that he has many fine qualities of his own that he has overlooked in his obsession with me. Indeed any reputation I have for mental acuity and sharpness comes in truth from the extraordinary contrast John so selflessly provides. It is a fact I believe brides tend to favor exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day. There is a certain analogy there I feel. And contrast is, after all, God's own plan to enhance the beauty of his creation. Or it would be if God were not a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide a career opportunity for the family idiot.
Sherlock Holmes: The point I'm trying to make is that I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet. I am dismissive of the virtuous, [He looks at the priest], unaware of the beautiful [He looks at the maid of honour] and uncomprehending in the face of the happy [He looks at Watson and Mary]. So if I didn't understand I was being asked to be best man, it is because I never expected to be anybody's best friend. And certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing.
John, I am a ridiculous man, [John nods] redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship. But, as I am apparently you best friend, I cannot congratulate you on your choice of companion. [Beat] Actually, now I can. [To Mary] Mary, when I say you deserve this man, it is the highest compliment of which I am capable.
John, you have endured war and injury and tragic loss - so sorry again about that last one - so know this; today you sit between the woman you have made your wife and the man you have saved. In short, the two people who love you most in all this world. And I know I speak for Mary as well when I say we will never let you down and we have a lifetime ahead to prove that.
[The guests wipe tears from their eyes]
John Watson: [Whispers to Mary] If I try and hug him, stop me.
Mary Watson: [Whispers back] Certainly not.
Sherlock Holmes: Ah yes, now on to some funny stories about John.
[Sherlock notices that the guests are all crying]
Sherlock Holmes: What's wrong? What happened? Why are you all doing that? John?
Mrs Hudson: [Crying] Oh, Sherlock!
Sherlock Holmes: [To John] Did I do it wrong?
John Watson: No, you didn't. Come here.

John Watson: Yeah, I know. I know.

Janine: Sherlock Holmes, you are a back-stabbing, heartless, manipulative bastard.
Sherlock Holmes: And you, as it turns out, are a grasping, opportunistic, publicity-hungry tabloid whore.
Janine: So, we're good, then?

Janine: You lied to me. You lied and lied.
Sherlock Holmes: I exploited the fact of our connection.
Janine: When? Just once would have been nice.
Sherlock Holmes: Oh. I was waiting til we got married.

John Watson: (panting with rage against Mary) I've got a better question: is everyone I've ever met a psychopath?
Sherlock Holmes: (short pause) Yes. Good that we've settled that. Now--
John Watson: SHUT UP!! And stay shut up, because this is not funny. Not this time.
Sherlock Holmes: I didn't say it was funny.
John Watson: (turns to Mary) You. What have I ever done? Hmm? My whole life, to deserve you?
Sherlock Holmes: Everything.
John Watson: (steps towards Sherlock threateningly) Sherlock, I told you. Shut up.
Sherlock Holmes: No, I mean it. Seriously. Everything, everything you've ever done is what you did.
John Watson: Sherlock, one more word and you will not need morphine.
Sherlock Holmes: You were a doctor who went to war. You're a man who couldn't stay in the suburbs for more than a month without storming a crack den, beating up a junkie. Your best friend is a sociopath who solves crimes as an alternative to getting high. That's me, by the way. (waves hand) Hello. Even the landlady used to run a drug cartel.
Mrs. Hudson: (surprised) It was my husband's cartel. I was just typing!
Sherlock Holmes: (offhandedly) And exotic dancing.
Mrs. Hudson: (insulted) Sherlock Holmes, if you've been YouTubing--
Sherlock Holmes: (losing patience) John, you're addicted to a certain lifestyle! You're abnormally attracted...to dangerous situations and people, so is it truly such a surprise that the woman you've fallen in love with conforms to that pattern?
John Watson: (voice breaking) But she wasn't supposed to be like that. Why is she like that?
Sherlock Holmes: Because you chose her.
John Watson: Why is everything...always...MY FAULT!?!? (kicks a chair aside ferociously)
Mrs. Hudson: (flees into the kitchen, horrified) Oh, the neighbours.
Sherlock Holmes: John, listen. Be calm and answer me. What is she?
John Watson: My lying wife.
Sherlock Holmes: No. What is she?
John Watson: The woman who is carrying my child who has lied to me since the day I met her.
Sherlock Holmes: No. Not in this flat. Not in this room. Right here, right now, what...is...she?
John Watson: Okay. Your way. (resentful) Always your way. (places a chair in front of Mary) Sit.
Mary Watson: Why?
John Watson: Because that's where they sit! The people who come in here with their stories. The clients. That's what you are now, Mary. You're a client. This is where you sit and talk and this is where we sit and listen and we decide if we want you or not!

John Watson: I've thought long and hard about what I want to say to you. These are prepared words, Mary. I've chosen these words with care.
Mary Watson: Okay.
John Watson: The problems of your past are your business. The problems of your future...are my privilege. That's all I have to say; that's all I need to know [He throws her USB stick in the fire] No, I did't read it.
Mary Watson: [crying] You don't even know my name.
John Watson: Is "Mary Watson" good enough for you?
Mary Watson: Yes! Oh my God, yes.
John Watson: Then it's good enough for me, too.
[they embrace]
John Watson: All this does not mean that I'm not still basically pissed off with you.
Mary Watson: Mm, I know, I know.
John Watson: I am very pissed off, and it will come out now and then.
Mary Watson: I know, I know, I know.
John Watson: You can mow the sodding lawn from now on.
Mary Watson: I do mow the lawn.
John Watson: I do it loads.
Mary Watson: You really don't.
John Watson: I choose the baby's name.
Mary Watson: Not a chance.

Mycroft Holmes: I have, by the way, a job offer I should like you to decline.
Sherlock Holmes: I...decline your kind offer.
Mycroft Holmes: I shall pass on your regrets.
Sherlock Holmes: What was it?
Mycroft Holmes: MI6. They want to place you back into Eastern Europe. An undercover assignment that would prove fatal to you in, I think, about six months.
Sherlock Holmes: Then why don't you want me to take it?
Mycroft Holmes: It's tempting, but on balance, you have more utility closer to home.
Sherlock Holmes: Utility! How do I have utility?
Mycroft Holmes: Here be dragons. [coughs on his cigarette] This isn't agreeing with me. I'm going in.
Sherlock Holmes: [amused] You need low tar. You still smoke like a beginner.
Mycroft Holmes: Also...your loss would break my heart.
[Sherlock chokes on his cigarette]
Sherlock Holmes: What the hell am I supposed to say to that?!
Mycroft Holmes: Merry Christmas?
Sherlock Holmes: You hate Christmas.
Mycroft Holmes: Yes. Perhaps there was something in the punch.
Sherlock Holmes: Clearly. Go and have some more.

Sherlock Holmes: One false move and we will have betrayed the security of the United Kingdom and be imprisoned for high treason. Magnusson is quite possibly the most dangerous man we've ever encountered and the odds are stacked incomprehensibly against us.

John Watson: Sherlock, what do we do?
Magnussen: Nothing! There's nothing to be done. Oh, I'm not a villain, I have no "evil plan". I'm a businessman, acquiring assets. You happen to be one of them. Sorry, no chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr. Holmes!
Sherlock: Oh, do your research. I'm not a hero, I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Merry Christmas! [shoots Magnussen in the head]
