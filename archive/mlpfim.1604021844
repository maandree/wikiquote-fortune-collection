Spike: Look on the bright side, Twilight, the Princess arranged for you to stay in a library! Doesn’t that make you happy?
Twilight Sparkle: [pauses, brightening up] Yes, yes, it does. You know why? Because I’m right. I’ll check on the preparations as fast as I can, then get to the library to find some proof of Nightmare Moon’s return.
Spike: Then when will you make friends, like the Princess said?

Rarity: Fine, I'm guilty! I wear false eyelashes!! [pauses] ...Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.

Twilight Sparkle: Yeah, great news. That I just got from a wedding invitation! Not from my brother, but from a piece of paper! Thanks a lot, Shining Armor. I mean, really, he couldn't tell me personally? [sarcastically, using a sandwich as a puppet] Hey, Twilight, just thought you should know I'm making a really big decision that changes everything.

Shining Armor: You want to know why my eyes went all [bells jangling]? Nuh! Because ever since I started having to perform my protection spell, I've been getting terrible migraines. Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me!
Twilight Sparkle: :[inhales]
Shining Armor: And she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be in the wedding was so that they could meet Canterlot royalty! And if she hasn't been on her best behavior with your [stomps hoof] friends, it's because with me being so busy, she's had to make all the decisions about the wedding!
Twilight Sparkle: I was just trying to–
Shining Armor: She's been completely stressed out because it's really important to her that her big day be perfect! Something that obviously wasn't important to you.

Queen Chrysalis: Right you are, Princess. And as queen of the changelings, it is up to me to find food for my subjects. Equestria has more love than any place I've ever encountered.

Queen Chrysalis: Soon, my changeling army will break through. First, we take Canterlot. And then, all of Equestria!

Twilight Sparkle: A little while ago, my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia sent me to live in Ponyville. She sent me to study friendship, which is something I didn't really care much about. But now, on a day like today, I can honestly say I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you. Each one of you taught me something about friendship, and for that, I will always be grateful. Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria. Thank you, friends, thank you, everypony.

[After the Mane 6 get their cutie marks back, Starlight is about to attack Party Favor, Sugar Belle, Night Glider, and Double Diamond, but Twilight deflects her magic]
Starlight Glimmer: Wh– I studied that spell for years! How can you—
Twilight Sparkle: I studied magic for years too! But what I didn't know then was that studying could only take me so far. Each of my friends has taught me something different about myself. It was their unique gifts and passions and personalities that helped bring out the magic inside of me. I never would have learned that I represent the element of magic without these five, and I certainly wouldn't be here to stop you now!
Starlight Glimmer: Spare me your sentimental nonsense! I gave these ponies real friendships they never could've had otherwise!
Double Diamond: How do you know that?! You never even gave us a chance!
[Starlight uses her magic to escape them and goes into hiding in a cave.]
Rainbow Dash: She's getting away!
Double Diamond: We'll never find her in there!

It's remarkable to me, how a story like Cranky's search for Matilda could fill this room with such a unique collection of ponies. It makes you realize that everypony is the star of their own story, and it's not just the main characters in our stories that make life so rich. It's everypony - those who play big parts, and those who play small. If it weren't for everypony in this room, and many more here who couldn't be here today, Cranky and Matilda's lives wouldn't be as full and vibrant as they are.

Twilight Sparkle: Obviously, the long-term effects of the simultaneous acquisition of cutie marks has yet to be determined, but... [sips water] Next slide, please?
[Long pause, Moondancer wakes Spike, who provides the slides]
Twilight Sparkle: I can speak from my own experience that the power of cutie mark magic is very real. And in the instance of my friends and I, it can be traced to a single event. Without Rainbow Dash’s race to defend Fluttershy’s honor, this Rainboom wouldn’t have happened. Fluttershy might never have discovered her love of animals...Applejack might never have realized that she belonged on her farm...And Pinkie Pie might never have decided to leave hers. It might be hard to imagine Rarity without her sense of fabulousness, but it’s even harder to fathom what my life would be like. without this Rainboom, I might not have gotten into magic school, Celestia wouldn’t have taken me on as her pupil, or sent me to Ponyville to meet my friends. And the most powerful thing about cutie mark magic that I’ve found is the connection I share with them.
[She stops as she notices Starlight Glimmer in the audience; she looks around, but she has vanished]
