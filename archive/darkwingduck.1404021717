Taurus Bulba: Let me understand this, Hammerhead... you and your "associates" are questioning my plan?
Hammerhead: Gee, boss, no... well, sorta. The boys and I were wondering if we couldn't wait until the train stops before we steal the Ramrod!
Taurus Bulba: Ohhhhhhhh, you mean after the army takes control of the weapon with its tanks and jeeps and hundreds of guards! [snorts angrily]
Hammerhead: I guess we didn't think of that! [to Hoof and Mouth] Why didn't you think of that?!
Taurus Bulba: [grabs Hammerhead by the neck] Because I am the brains and you are the stooge!
Hammerhead: [wheezing] That's it, boss. I'm a stooge. Just call me Curly! [chokes]

Taurus Bulba: The Ramrod is useless without the arming code. Unfortunately, someone arranged an accident for Professor Waddlemeyer last year before I could learn it! Go to the St. Canard Orphanage and bring me his granddaughter. She was practically raised in his lab. If anyone knows the code, she does. After we get the code, then she can have an accident [laughs] like her grandfather. I trust you can get the order right this time!
Hammerhead: No problem. Code first, THEN accident.

Gosalyn: [to Hammerhead] After Mom and Dad died, Grandpa was the only family I had in the whole world. But since he's been gone, I've made lots of friends here, so it's not so bad. [sighs] Until adoption day. Seems like I'm always saying good-bye... to someone. You know, I'm not a problem child! Grandpa said I just have a lot of spirit. He says when you're full of spirit, everyone else looks empty. Someday I'll meet somebody who understands that. Then I'll be adopted.

Darkwing: A desperate criminal is at large, and terror runs through the streets like a pair of cheap stockings! But it's hopeless! No one gets the drop on Dark-
Gosalyn: [drops on top of Darkwing] Gosalyn Waddlemeyer! Boy, Darkwing, you gotta work on your narration. They write better stuff on Saturday morning cartoons.
Darkwing: Oh yeah? Well, how's this? [flips Gosalyn upside down] In a lightning move, Darkwing turns the tables-

Gosalyn: How come you wear a mask?
Darkwing: Because... there is nothing so terrifying to the criminal mind as the unknown... I am the thing that goes bump in the night! I am the neurosis that requires a five-hundred-dollar-an-hour shrink!
Gosalyn: You mean you don't take off your mask for anyone?
Darkwing: That's right. Not no one, not never.
Gosalyn: What about a really, really, really close friend? [bats eyelashes]

Darkwing: What is a Waddlemeyer Ramrod anyway?
Gosalyn: [recites] It's a trackiospecific device that disrupts gravitational bonds on a molecular level allowing manipulation on a macro scale.
Darkwing: What does that mean?
Gosalyn: I dunno. I think it makes things float and stuff. [pulls out a photo] Here's a photo. That's grandpa.
Darkwing: Looks like you two were close.
Gosalyn: [sadly] We were. [crosses arms] But he never told me any code!
Darkwing: Unfortunately, Taurus Bulba doesn't know that. His men will be searching for you, you know. [chuckles] Although if they knew how much spirit you have, they'd probably run the other way.
Gosalyn: Spirit? [kisses Darkwing's cheek] Thanks, Darkwing!
