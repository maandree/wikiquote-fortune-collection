Half-sick with the thrill, complete wrongness. I don't fight him. I don't want to. He's all I've got. Nothing else could love me, not even … especially not me. Or is that just a lie the Dark Passenger tells me? Because, lately, there are these moments that I feel connected to something else. Someone. It's like … the mask is slipping, and things, people, that never mattered before, are suddenly starting to matter. It scares the hell out of me.

I think Harry knew that from the start. That's why he gave me a code. It cost him his life, but it kept me alive through incredible trials. The code is mine now, and mine alone. So too are the relationships I cultivate.
They're not just disguises anymore. I need them. Even if they make me vulnerable. My father might not approve, but I'm no longer his disciple. I'm a master now. An idea transcended into life.
And so this is my new path. Which is a lot like the old one, only mine. To stay on that path I need to work harder, explore new rituals, evolve. Am I evil? Am I good? I'm done asking those questions. I don't have the answers. Does anyone?

Jamie: Yeah, so sad.
Angel: Well, I think he's putting it all behind him at least.
Jamie: Well, I don't know. Some nights...
Angel: What?
Jamie: It just seems like some nights, the pain, the loneliness, whatever it is he's feeling, gets to be too much and he's just gotta disappear for a while, go out on his boat. I think he's trying to keep it away from Harrison.
Angel: Yeah. He really loves his son. Poor guy needs a hobby or something.

Debra: Dexter, I've been thinking a lot about Rita. About how she died. She died because of you. Because you were selfish. You have a son. Harrison is three years old. Someone needs to protect him.

Dexter: [Voiceover: Chemistry. I've heard some people have it - an attraction that can't be quantified or explained. Is that the reason behind this...loss of control? Maybe the desire to get Hannah on my table was just a way to deny the effect she has on me - so now what?]

Isaak:That's how love is. It's a powerful weapon. It can work for us or against us, can't it?
Dexter:I don't understand much about love.
Isaak:I suppose the heart knows something that we just don't know.
Dexter:Or maybe the heart is just wrong.

Isaak:We're outsiders, you and I. On the periphery. Watching everybody else. Pretending we're just like them, but knowing we're not. Best we can hope for is to find a place where we don't have to pretend.
Dexter: [Voiceover: Everyone wants an Argentina - a place where the slate is wiped clean. But the truth is Argentina is just Argentina. No matter where we go, we take ourselves, and our damage, with us. So is home the place we run to, or is it the place we run from? Onlt to hide out in places where we're accepted unconditionally, places that feel more like home to us - because we can finally be who we are.]

Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell anyone, they wouldn't believe me even if I did. But knowing that you have to live with it is...punishment enough. Still, I'm curious - how do you justify arresting me and not him? Or is the law just something you make up as you go along? Turning a blind eye whenever you feel like it or Dexter is involved.

Batista: Hey, what do we have?
Dexter: Robert Bailey, killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest, right above the heart.
Masuka: Judging from the stippling on the wound, it looks like the muzzle of the gun was in contact with the victim's chest when fired.
Batista: Suicide?
Dexter: No, the victim was killed elsewhere and dumped here. [Dexter lifts the victim's head. A part of the head falls. He raises the part to reveal a piece of the brain] Parietal and occipital bone sliced through. Back of the cranium removed.
Batista: Okay, that's weird.
Dexter: And looks like a piece of it has been scooped out, like with a melon baller.
Quinn: Just got weirder.
Det. Miller: We have a gun.
Batista: So someone shoots this guy, cuts his head open, and messes with his brain. He takes the body and the weapon and brings them all the way out here. Why?

Dr. Vogel: Daniel, whatever mistakes I've made in the past, I want to make it up to you. I can help you.
Saxon: Help me how?
Dr. Vogel: I can arrange for the care you need.
Saxon: The care I need? I will never be locked up again.
Dr. Vogel: I have contacts at the best facilities.
Saxon: Like the last one you sent me to? Do you know what that was like? Day after day wondering when you'd finally come to visit, only to realize that the answer was never!
Dr. Vogel: Daniel, I couldn't. You'd killed Richard.
Saxon: That was your fault! You ignored me. All you ever cared about was Richard. You never tried to help me.
Dr. Vogel: I was young, inexperienced. I didn't know how to help you.
Saxon: But you sure as hell knew how to help Dexter Morgan. You taught him how to deal with his condition. You gave him everything you denied me. While I was rotting away, you gave him a life.
Dr. Vogel: I know that. I do. It was a horrible mistake.
Saxon: I was your son. I needed you.
Dr. Vogel: Please...
Saxon: Please what?!

Dexter: You went out of your way to kill your mother in front of me, and you expect me to forget?
Saxon: [chuckles] That may have been a little over the top, but I was trying to make a point.
Dexter: I missed the point.
Saxon: It was a test, to see if, this time, she would finally choose me. Well, we both know how that turned out.
Dexter: So, naturally you had to cut her throat.
Saxon: You know what it's like to kill. It can be cathartic... and it was. That's why I'm giving you a choice: Go on with your life, or come after me.

Debra: I think we'd need to save a busload of nuns or something.
